Welcome to the Bland Platform.

Bland is designed to be simple, secure, and easy to use for any use case.

Whether you're using Bland for inbound, outbound, or something in between (whatever that might be), we've got you covered. 

Here's the basics that you should know before diving in:

1. Bland is fully self hosted, meaning your data stays entirely secure from end-to-end.
2. We have the lowest latency on the planet, making your calls sound human.
3. Our platform is designed for everyone - technical or not - to be able to build any agent, for any use case.

And if you ever need any help along the way, we have a [Discord](https://discord.gg/QvxDz8zcKe) with live support and daily office hours to help solve any and all problems.

Point being - we want to give you all the tools you'd need to build the agent needed for your business.

We're glad to have you here - go build something Bland.
