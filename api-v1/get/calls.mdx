  The total number of calls that match the query filters. This number may be greater than the number of calls returned in the response.

  The number of calls returned in the response.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="calls" type="array">
  An array of call data objects. See the [Call](/api-v1/get/calls-id) section for details.
