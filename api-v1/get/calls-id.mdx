</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_id" type="number">
  The unique identifier for the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_length" type="number">
  The length of the call in minutes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="batch_id" type="string">
  If the call is part of a batch, it's `batch_id` will be here.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
  The phone number that received the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
  The phone number that made the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="request_data" type="object">
  Details about parameters in the original api request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="completed" type="boolean">
  Whether the call has been completed. If it differs from the value of 'queue_status', this will be the most up-to-date status.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="inbound" type="boolean">
  Whether the call was inbound or outbound. Will be `false` for outbound calls.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  The timestamp for when the call request was created.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="started_at" type="string">
  The time the call was connected.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="end_at" type="string">
  The time that the call will automatically be ended at if it's still connected (because of `max_duration`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queue_status" type="string">
  The status of the call. During extremely high volume periods, calls may be queued for a short period of time before being dispatched.


  <Accordion title="Statuses:">
  Progresses through the following stages:

  - `new`: An API request has been received.
  - `queued`: Call pararameters have been validated and authentication succeeded. 
  - `allocated`: Extremely brief, the call is being dispatched.
  - `started`: The phone call is live and in progress.
  - `complete`: The phone call has ended successfully.
  
  The following statuses show the point that was reached before an error:

  - `pre_queue_error`: An error occurred before the call was queued. Invalid parameters generally cause this.
  - `queue_error`: Error occurred while the call was queued. Ex. Valid phone number but to an unserviced area.
  - `call_error`: Error occurred during live call. May be caused by transferring to an invalid phone number or an unforeseen error.
  - `complete_error`: Error occurred after the call was completed. Ex. A post-call webhook failed.

  If at any point an error occurs, it will be recorded in the `error_message` field.
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint_url" type="string">
  The url of the deployment that the call was handled on. Will always be "api.prod.bland.ai" unless the call was handled on a custom Enterprise deployment.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_duration" type="number">
  The maximum length of time the call was allowed to last. If the call would exceed this length, it's ended early.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error_message" type="string">
  If an error occurs, this will contain a description of the error. Otherwise, it will be null.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="object">
  Variables created during the call - both system variables as well as generated with `dynamic_data` or Custom Tools.

  For example, if you used a `dynamic_data` API request to generate a variable called `appointment_time`, you would see it here (both the agent's inputs and the response variables).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="answered_by" type="string">
  If `answered_by_enabled` was set to `true` in the original API request, this field contains one of the following values:

  - `human`: The call was answered by a human.
  - `voicemail`: The call was answered by an answering machine or voicemail.
  - `unknown`: There was not enough audio at the start of the call to make a determination.
  - `no-answer`: The call was not answered.
  - `null`: Not enabled, or still processing the result.

  If `answered_by_enabled` was set to `true`, then webhooks may take up to a minute to fire after the call ends while the call audio is processed.

  <Accordion title="Notes:">
  - Determinations are based on audio from the first five seconds of the phone call.
  - `unknown` is most likely a human, especially if there are multiple transcripts.
  - Optimize calls for accurate results by getting humans to respond in the first five seconds:
    - Increase `speed` in `voice_settings`
    - Use with `wait_for_greeting`
    - Use a short greeting in `first_sentence` such as "Hello?" or "Hi, is this \{\{name\}\}?"
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="record" type="boolean">
  Whether the call audio was recorded.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="recording_url" type="string">
  The URL of the recording of the call. Only available if `record` was set to `true` in the original API request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metadata" type="object">
  Metadata about the call. This can include information about the client, customer, or any other data you want to include.

  This is identical to the `metadata` that was set in the original API request to send the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="summary" type="string">
  A short summary of the call based off of the transcript that's generated when the call ends.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="price" type="number">
  The cost of the call in USD.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="local_dialing" type="boolean">
  Whether Local Dialing was enabled for your account at the time of the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_ended_by" type="string">
  Whether the call was ended by Bland's system or the other end of the line.

  - `ASSISTANT`: The agent ended the call.
  - `USER`: The user ended the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="pathway_logs" type="string">
  Pathways calls will have extra logs here that have much more detailed information about the chosen nodes and internal reasoning throughout the flow.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="analysis_schema" type="object">
  The provided structure used in the post call analysis. This is the raw skeleton describing the data structure that will be filled in once the call ends.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="analysis" type="object">
  The data filled in by the post call analysis. This is the raw data that was generated by the analysis schema.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="concatenated_transcript" type="string">
  A single string containing all of the text from the call. Excludes system messages and auto-generated data.

  - `user` (can be `user`, `assistant`, `robot`, or `agent-action`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  The status of the call. This is the most up-to-date status of the call, but is only present for calls that have been successfully created.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="corrected_duration" type="string">
