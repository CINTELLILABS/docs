</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queue_status" type="string">
  The status of the call. During extremely high volume periods, calls may be queued for a short period of time before being dispatched.


  <Accordion title="Statuses:">
  Progresses through the following stages:

  - `new`: An API request has been received.
  - `queued`: Call pararameters have been validated and authentication succeeded. 
  - `allocated`: Extremely brief, the call is being dispatched.
  - `started`: The phone call is live and in progress.
  - `complete`: The phone call has ended successfully.
  
  The following statuses show the point that was reached before an error:

  - `pre_queue_error`: An error occurred before the call was queued. Invalid parameters generally cause this.
  - `queue_error`: Error occurred while the call was queued. Ex. Valid phone number but to an unserviced area.
  - `call_error`: Error occurred during live call. May be caused by transferring to an invalid phone number or an unforeseen error.
  - `complete_error`: Error occurred after the call was completed. Ex. A post-call webhook failed.

  If at any point an error occurs, it will be recorded in the `error_message` field.
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="variables" type="object">
  Variables created during the call - both system variables as well as generated with `dynamic_data` or Custom Tools.

  For example, if you used a `dynamic_data` API request to generate a variable called `appointment_time`, you would see it here (both the agent's inputs and the response variables).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="answered_by" type="string">
  This field contains one of the following values:

  - `human`: The call was answered by a human.
  - `voicemail`: The call was answered by an answering machine or voicemail.
  - `unknown`: There was not enough audio at the start of the call to make a determination.
  - `no-answer`: The call was not answered.
  - `null`: Not enabled, or still processing the result.

  Webhooks may take up to a minute to fire after the call ends while the call audio is processed.

  <Accordion title="Notes:">
  - Determinations are based on audio from the first five seconds of the phone call.
  - `unknown` is most likely a human, especially if there are multiple transcripts.
  - Optimize calls for accurate results by getting humans to respond in the first five seconds:
    - Use with `wait_for_greeting`
    - Use a short greeting in `first_sentence` such as "Hello?" or "Hi, is this \{\{name\}\}?"
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="record" type="boolean">
  Whether the call audio was recorded.
</ResponseField>

  Pathways calls will have extra logs here that have much more detailed information about the chosen nodes and internal reasoning throughout the flow.
</ResponseField>

  The provided structure used in the post call analysis. This is the raw skeleton describing the data structure that will be filled in once the call ends.

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  The status of the call. This is the most up-to-date status of the call, but is only present for calls that have been successfully created.

  <Accordion title="Call Status Values">
    **Possible status values:**

    - `completed` - Call was successfully completed, this can be both human or voicemail answered (see [answered_by](/api-v1/get/calls-id#param-answered-by) for details on who the call was answered by)
    - `failed` - Call failed to connect or complete (see `error_message` for details)
    - `busy` - Called number was busy
    - `no-answer` - Call was not answered
    - `canceled` - Call was canceled before completion
    - `unknown` - Status could not be determined

    **Common failure reasons and troubleshooting:**

    When `status` is `failed`, check the `error_message` field for specific details:

    - **"The number you dialed is not found."** 
      - The phone number is invalid or not in service
      - Verify the phone number format and that it's currently active

    - **"The number you dialed is temporarily unavailable."** 
      - Network issues or temporary service disruption
      - Retry the call after a short delay

    - **"The number you dialed is busy. Please try again later."** 
      - Called party is on another call without call waiting
      - Try calling at a different time

    - **"Service Provider Blocked Call due to Spam or Number Reputation. Try a different number."** 
      - Call blocked by carrier due to spam filtering
      - Use a different `from` number or contact your carrier
  </Accordion>
</ResponseField>

</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="citations" type="array of objects">
  Citations extracted from the transcript if a citation schema was attached to the call.
  
   You can build a citation schema [here](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/analytics?tab=citations).

  > Note: Citation schemas are very powerful and accurate, but also are more resource intensive to run. As such, for the time being, they are an enterprise-only feature.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="warm_transfer_call" type="object">
  Information about warm transfer calls if the call was part of a warm transfer. Contains details about proxy agent calls and transfer state.

    - `call_id`: The unique identifier of the proxy agent call
    - `phone_number`: The phone number used for the proxy agent call
