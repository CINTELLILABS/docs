### Response

<ResponseField name="transcripts" type="array of objects">
  An array of phrases spoken during the call. 
  
  Each index includes: 
  
  - `id`
  - `created_at` 
  - `text` 
  - `user` (can be `user`, `assistant`, `robot`, or `agent-action`)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="c_id" type="number">
  The unique identifier for the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="to" type="string">
  The phone number that received the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="from" type="string">
  The phone number that made the call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="request_data" type="object">
  Details about parameters in the original api request.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="completed" type="boolean">
  Whether the call has been completed. If it differs from the value of 'queue_status', this will be the most up-to-date status.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="queue_status" type="string">
  The status of the call. During extremely high volume periods, calls may be queued for a short period of time before being dispatched.

  Progresses through the following stages:

  - `new`: An API request has been received.
  - `queued`: Call pararameters have been validated and authentication succeeded. 
  - `allocated`: Extremely brief, the call is being dispatched.
  - `started`: The phone call is live and in progress.
  - `complete`: The phone call has ended successfully.
  
  The following statuses show the point that was reached before an error:

  - `pre_queue_error`: An error occurred before the call was queued. Invalid parameters generally cause this.
  - `queue_error`: Error occurred while the call was queued. Ex. Valid phone number but to an unserviced area.
  - `call_error`: Error occurred during live call. May be caused by transferring to an invalid phone number or an unforeseen error.
  - `complete_error`: Error occurred after the call was completed. Ex. A post-call webhook failed.

  If at any point an error occurs, it will be recorded in the `error_message` field.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="error_message" type="string or null">
  If an error occurs, this will contain a description of the error. Otherwise, it will be null.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="endpoint_url" type="string">
  The URL that was called to dispatch the phone call.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_duration" type="number">
  The maximum length of time the call was allowed to last. If the call would exceed this length, it's ended early.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="corrected_duration" type="number">
  The total length of time the call was connected. This differs from call_length in that it includes ringing and connection time.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_length" type="number or null">
  The length of the call in seconds (or null if ongoing).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  The timestamp for when the call was dispatched.
</ResponseField>
