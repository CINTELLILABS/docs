title: "Backfill Citation Schema"
api: "POST https://api.bland.ai/v1/citation_schemas/backfill"
description: "Retroactively apply a citation schema to extract data from an existing call transcript."
---

## Overview

The backfill endpoint allows you to apply a citation schema to a call that has already been completed. This is useful when you create a new schema and want to extract data from historical calls, or when you need to re-analyze a call with an updated schema.

<Info>
  This is an **Enterprise-only feature**. Contact your Bland representative or reach out to sales to enable this functionality.
</Info>

<Warning>
  Backfilling will overwrite any existing citation data for the specified call and schema combination. This operation cannot be undone.
</Warning>
