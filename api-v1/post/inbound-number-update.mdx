    The inbound phone number you wish to update. 
    
    Formatting Notes:
    - The `'+'` or `'%2B'` prefix is optional.

    - `%2B13334445555`

</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
    Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow. 

    For inbound numbers, consider including additional context about the purpose of the call, and what types of callers to expect.

    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively: 
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`. 
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_phone_number" type="string">
  A phone number that the agent can transfer to under specific conditions - such as being asked to speak to a human or supervisor.

  Set to `null` to remove.

    <Accordion title="Prompting Notes">
        For best results:
        - Specify conditions that the agent should transfer to a human under (examples are great!)
        - In the `task`, refer to the action solely as "transfer" or "transferring".
        - Alternate phrasing such as "swap" or "switch" can mislead the agent, causing the action to be ignored.
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_id" type="integer">
  Set your agent's voice - all available voices can be found with the [List Voices](/api-v1/get/voices) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="reduce_latency" type="boolean" default="true">
  Reducing latency means that the agent will generate responses more quickly and have less of a delay. This must be set to ```true``` when using Voice Clones.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id
  and transcript to this URL after the call completes. This can be useful if you
  want to have real time notifications when calls finish.

  Set to `null` or an empty string to clear the webhook.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  A phrase that your call will start with instead of a generating one on the fly. This works both with and without `wait_for_greeting`. Can be more than one sentence, but must be less than 200 characters.

  To remove, set to `null` or an empty string.
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="voice_settings" type="Voice Settings Object">
  Alter advanced voice settings for your agent.

  To remove, set to `null` or an empty string.
  <Expandable title="properties">
  <ParamField body="stability" default="0.8" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Adjust the predictability and consistency of the AI agent's voice. Lower values allow larger deviations from the baseline voice, whether default or cloned. Setting this too high however can cause a monotone voice.

  Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="similarity" default="0.6" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Higher values will make speech differences between the selected voice and others more prominent. Extremely high values can cause voice distortion.

  Use lower values to lower the distinctiveness of the voice or eliminate unwanted audio static spikes.

  Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="speed" default="0.85" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.
  
  Note #2: Setting `reduce_latency` to `false` will cause this parameter to be ignored.

  How fast your agent talks! This parameter is simply a speech-speed multiplier, and works with fractional values such as `0.5` or large ones like `2`.

  Accepts decimal values between `0.1` and `5` (inclusive).
</ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="object">
  Integrate data from external APIs into your agent's knowledge. 

  Set to `null` or an empty string to clear dynamic data settings.

  Detailed usage in the [Send Call](/api-v1/post/calls) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="integer (milliseconds)" default={50}>
  When you increase the interruption latency, you force the AI phone agent to listen longer before responding. In practice, increasing the threshold results in less interruptions and more latency.

  Try setting the threshold to `500` milliseconds. You'll encounter higher latency, but you'll be interrupted less frequently.

  Set to `null` to reset to default.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Whether the update was successful or not - will be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message describing the status of the update.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updates" type="object">
  An object containing the updated settings for the inbound number.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="failed_updates" type="object">
  If the update was unsuccessful, this will contain the settings that failed to update. Useful to determine how your request is being interpreted on our end.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Successfully updated number +18584139939.",
    "updates": {
        "prompt": "(Your prompt)",
        "voice_id": 1,
        "webhook": null,
        "first_sentence": "Roberta speaking, how can I help you?",
        "reduce_latency": false,
        "record": false
    }
}
