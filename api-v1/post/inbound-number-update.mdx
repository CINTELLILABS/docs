    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively: 
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`. 
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
