### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="encrypted_key" type="string">
  The `encrypted_key` for the Twilio account that owns the phone number you want to modify. Not required if you are using a Bland phone number.
</ParamField>

### Path Parameters

    The inbound phone number you wish to update. 
    
    Formatting Notes:
    - The `'+'` or `'%2B'` prefix is optional.

</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="prompt" type="string" required>
    Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow. 

    For inbound numbers, consider including additional context about the purpose of the call, and what types of callers to expect.

    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively: 
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`. 
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pathway_id" type="string">
    Set the pathway that your agent will follow. This will override the `prompt` field, so there is no need to pass the 'prompt' field if you are setting a pathway.

    Warning: Setting a pathway will set the following fields to `null` / their default value - `prompt`, `first_sentence`, `model`, `dynamic_data`, `tools`

    Set to `null` or an empty string to clear the pathway.
</ParamField>

### Agent Parameters (Body)

<ParamField body="voice" type="string">
  Set your agent's voice - all available voices can be found with the [List Voices](/api-v1/get/voices) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  Makes your agent say a specific phrase or sentence for it's first response.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="wait_for_greeting" type="boolean" default={false}>
  By default, the agent starts talking as soon as the call connects. 
  
  When `wait_for_greeting` is set to `true`, the agent will wait for the call recipient to speak first before responding.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="number" default={100}>
  Adjusts how patient the AI is when waiting for the user to finish speaking.

  Lower values mean the AI will respond more quickly, while higher values mean the AI will wait longer before responding.

  Recommended range: 50-200
  - 50: Extremely quick, back and forth conversation
  - 100: Balanced to respond at a natural pace
  - 200: Very patient, allows for long pauses and interruptions. Ideal for collecting detailed information.

  Try to start with 100 and make small adjustments in increments of ~10 as needed for your use case.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string" default="enhanced">
  Select a model to use for your call.

  Options: `base`, `turbo` and `enhanced`.

  In nearly all cases, `enhanced` is the best choice for now.

  <Accordion title="Model Differences">

  There are three different ways to use Bland:

  - `model: base`
    - The original, follows scripts/procedures most effectively.
    - Supports all features and capabilities.
    - Best for Custom Tools
  
  - `model: enhanced`
    - Much faster latency and very conversational, works best with objective-based prompts.
    - Supports all features and capabilities.

  - `model: turbo`
    - The absolute fastest latency possible, can be verbose at times
    - Limited capabilities currently (excludes Transferring, IVR navigation, Custom Tools)
    - Extremely realistic conversation capabilities

  </Accordion>

</ParamField>

<ParamField hidden="language_detection_period" type="integer">
  After this many seconds have passed, the language detection will run and change the AI's language configuration if it's different from the initial setting.

  Shorter periods make the language switch faster, while longer periods are more accurate.

  Valid range: 10-100 seconds.

  The current language at a given moment can be accessed via the `{{language}}` prompt variable in Pathways.
</ParamField>

<ParamField hidden="language_detection_options" type="string[]">
  If `language_detection_period` is set, this array can be used to narrow down the languages that the AI can switch to.

  By default, these select languages can be detected (and switched to) at any time during the call:

  <Accordion title="Expand to view language detection options">

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="timezone" type="string" default="America/Los_Angeles">
  Set the timezone for the call. Handled automatically for calls in the US.

  This helps significantly with use cases that rely on appointment setting, scheduling, or behaving differently based on the time of day.

  Timezone options are [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in the TZ identifier column.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_phone_number" type="string">
  A phone number that the agent can transfer to under specific conditions - such as being asked to speak to a human or supervisor.

  Set to `null` to remove.

    <Accordion title="Prompting Notes">
        For best results:
        - Specify conditions that the agent should transfer to a human under (examples are great!)
        - In the `task`, refer to the action solely as "transfer" or "transferring".
        - Alternate phrasing such as "swap" or "switch" can mislead the agent, causing the action to be ignored.
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_list" type="object">
  Give your agent the ability to transfer calls to a set of phone numbers.

  Overrides `transfer_phone_number` if a `transfer_list.default` is specified.

  Will default to `transfer_list.default`, or the chosen phone number.

  Example usage to route calls to different departments:

  ```json
  "transfer_list": {
      "default": "+12223334444",
      "sales": "+12223334444",
      "support": "+12223334444",
      "billing": "+12223334444"
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="object">
  Integrate data from external APIs into your agent's knowledge. 

  Set to `null` or an empty string to clear dynamic data settings.

  Detailed usage in the [Send Call](/api-v1/post/calls) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="number" default={100}>
  Adjusts how patient the AI is when waiting for the user to finish speaking.

  Lower values mean the AI will respond more quickly, while higher values mean the AI will wait longer before responding.

  Recommended range: 50-200
  - 50: Extremely quick, back and forth conversation
  - 100: Balanced to respond at a natural pace
  - 200: Very patient, allows for long pauses and interruptions. Ideal for collecting detailed information.

  Try to start with 100 and make small adjustments in increments of ~10 as needed for your use case.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="keywords" type="string[]" default="[]">
  These words will be boosted in the transcription engine - recommended for proper nouns or words that are frequently mis-transcribed.

  For example, if the word "Reece" is frequently transcribed as a homonym like "Reese" you could do this:
  ```json
  {
    "keywords": ["Reece"]
  }
  ```

  For stronger keyword boosts, you can place a colon then a boost factor after the word. The default boost factor is 2.
  ```json
  {
    "keywords": ["Reece:3"]
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

### Call Settings (Body)

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="integer" default="30">
  When the call starts, a timer is set for the `max_duration` minutes. At the end of that timer, if the call is still active it will be automatically ended.
  
  Example Values: ```20, 2```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  When the call ends, we'll send the call details in a POST request to the URL you specify here.

  The request body will match the response from the [GET /v1/calls/:call_id](/api-v1/get/calls-id) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="analysis_schema" type="object">
  Define a JSON schema for how you want to get information about the call - information like email addresses, names, appointment times or any other type of custom data.

  In the webhook response or whenever you retrieve call data later, you'll get the data you defined back under `analysis`.

  For example, if you wanted to retrieve this information from the call:

  ```json
  "analysis_schema": {
    "email_address": "email",
    "first_name": "string",
    "last_name": "string",
    "wants_to_book_appointment": "boolean",
    "appointment_time": "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
  }
  ```

  You would get it filled out like this in your webhook once the call completes:

  ```json
  "analysis": {
    "email_address": "johndoe@gmail.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "wants_to_book_appointment": true,
    "appointment_time": "2024-01-01 12:00:00"
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
  Add any additional information you want to associate with the call. This can be useful for tracking or categorizing calls.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="summary_prompt" type="string">
  At the end of each call, a `summary` is generated based on the transcript - you can use this field to add extra instructions and context for how it should be summarized.

  For example: `"Summarize the call in French instead of English."`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="analysis_prompt" type="string">
  Guides the output and provides additional instructions and clarifications for the `analysis_schema`.
</ParamField>


<ParamField body="record" type="boolean" default="false">
  To record your phone call, set `record` to true. When your call completes, you can access through the `recording_url` field in the call details or your webhook.  
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Whether the update was successful or not - will be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="message" type="string">
  A message describing the status of the update.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updates" type="object">
  An object containing the updated settings for the inbound number.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="failed_updates" type="object">
  If the update was unsuccessful, this will contain the settings that failed to update. Useful to determine how your request is being interpreted on our end.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Successfully updated number +18584139939.",
