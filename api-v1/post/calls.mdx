### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>
### Body

<ParamField body="phone_number" type="string" required>
  The phone number to call. Country code defaults to `+1` (US) if not specified. 
  
  Formatting is flexible, however for the most predictable results use the [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164#examples-of-e164-numbers) format.

    <Accordion title="Formatting Examples">
        Expected/Ideal Format:
        - "+12223334444"
        - "+91223334444"
        - "+61223334444"

        Valid, but not recommended:
        - "2223334444"
        - "+1 (222) 333-4444"
        - "+1 222 333 4444"
        - "222-333-4444"

        Invalid: 
        - "12223334444"
        - "552223334444"
        - "non-numeric characters"
        - "2223334444 ext. 123"
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="string" required>
  Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow.

    <Accordion title="Best Practices">
        #### Out-of-the-Box Behaviors (Summarized):
        - Speech pattern: Direct, concise, casual
        - Spells out symbols, acronyms, abbreviations, percentages, etc. ($4,000,000 -> "four million dollars")
        - Asks clarifying questions
        - Ends call when objective is complete or voicemail is detected

        #### Prompting Tips:
        - Want to easily test out exactly how your agent will behave?
            - [Try out Agent Testing!](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=testing)
        - Aim for less than >2,000 characters where possible.
        - Simple, direct prompts are the most predictable and reliable.
        - Frame instructions positively: 
            - `"Do this"` rather than `"Don't do this"`. 
            - Ex. "Keep the conversation casual" rather than "Don't be too formal".
            - This gives concrete examples of what to do, instead of leaving expected behavior open to interpretation.
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_list" type="object">
  Give your agent the ability to transfer calls to a set of phone numbers.

  Overrides `transfer_phone_number` if a `transfer_list.default` is specified.

  Will default to `transfer_list.default`, or the chosen phone number.

  Example usage to route calls to different departments:

  ```json
  "transfer_list": {
      "default": "+12223334444",
      "sales": "+12223334444",
      "support": "+12223334444",
      "billing": "+12223334444"
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" type="string" default="enhanced">
  Select a model to use for your call.

  Options: `base`, `turbo` and `enhanced`.

  In nearly all cases, `enhanced` is the best choice for now.

  <Accordion title="Model Differences">

  There are three different ways to use Bland:

  - `model: base`
    - The original, follows scripts/procedures most effectively.
    - Supports all features and capabilities.
    - Best for Custom Tools
  
  - `model: enhanced`
    - Much faster latency and very conversational, works best with objective-based prompts.
    - Supports all features and capabilities.

  - `model: turbo`
    - The absolute fastest latency possible, can be verbose at times
    - Limited capabilities currently (excludes Transferring, IVR navigation, Custom Tools)
    - Extremely realistic conversation capabilities

  </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="tools" type="array">
  Interact with the real world through API calls.

  Detailed tutorial here: [Custom Tools](/tutorials/custom-tools)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_phone_number" type="string">
  A phone number that the agent can transfer to under specific conditions - such as being asked to speak to a human or supervisor.

    <Accordion title="Prompting Notes">
        For best results:
        - Specify conditions that the agent should transfer to a human under (examples are great!)
        - In the `task`, refer to the action solely as "transfer" or "transferring".
        - Alternate phrasing such as "swap" or "switch" can mislead the agent, causing the action to be ignored.
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="answered_by_enabled" type="boolean" default={false}>
  Enables machine detection when the call starts to determine whether the call was answered by a person or a voicemail.

  Best Practices (when enabled):
  - Since the determination is made at the beginning of the call, use `wait_for_greeting` to try and coax a human response.
  - If combined with `first_sentence`, try wording it so the person answering says something back - ex. `"Hello?"` or `"Is this \{\{name\}\}?"`.

  Price: `$0.02` per call, however there is no charge for unanswered calls or calls that failed to send.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="from" type="string">
  Specify a purchased Outbound Number to call from. Country code is required, spaces or parentheses must be excluded.

  By default, calls are initiated from a separate pool of numbers owned by Bland.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="reduce_latency" type="boolean" default="true">
  Reducing latency means that the agent will generate responses more quickly and have less of a delay. This must be set to ```true``` when using Voice Clones.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_id" type="number" default="0">
    Determines the voice of the AI agent, in conjunction with `reduce_latency`. 
  
    Use the [GET /v1/voices](https://api.bland.ai/voices) endpoint to see a full list of your available voices.

    To create your own Voice Clone, [visit our Custom Voice Cloning page](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=voice-clone).

    <Accordion title="Default Options">

    (Note: The voice is accessed by the numeric ID, not the name)

    Reduced Latency Voices (`reduce_latency: true`):
        - 0: `matt`
        - 1: `sophie-australian`
        - 2: `jen-english`

    Standard Voices (`reduce_latency: false`):
        - 0: `grace-southern`
        - 1: `josh`
        - 2: `dorothy-british`
        - 3: `ravi`
        
        (continues with celebrity voices)
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_preset_id" type="string">
  Use a voice preset instead of specifying individual voice settings.

  To create a voice preset, see [Create a Voice Preset](/api-v1/post/voices).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="start_time" type="string">
  The time you want the call to start. If you don't specify a time (or the time is in the past), the call will send immediately.
  
  Set your time in the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS -HH:MM` (ex. `2021-01-01 12:00:00 -05:00`).

  The timezone is optional, and defaults to UTC if not specified.

  Note: Scheduled calls can be cancelled with the [POST /v1/calls/:call_id/stop](/api-v1/post/calls-id-stop) endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id
  and transcript to this URL after the call completes. This can be useful if you
  want to have real time notifications when calls finish.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="wait_for_greeting" type="boolean" default="false">
  Should the AI speak first or wait for someone else to talk?
  
  Creates more realistic conversations when answered with "Hello?", "This is \{name\} speaking." and so on.
  
  - When ```false```: The AI starts speaking shortly after the call is answered. 
  
  - When ```true```: The AI will wait for the answerer to speak.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  A phrase that your call will start with instead of a generating one on the fly. This works both with and without `wait_for_greeting`. Can be more than one sentence, but must be less than 200 characters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="record" type="boolean" default="false">
  To record your phone call, set `record` to true. When your call completes, you can access the recording by requesting the `/call/recording` endpoint.
</ParamField>

<ResponseField name="voice_settings" type="Voice Settings Object">
  <Expandable title="properties">
  <ParamField body="stability" default="0.8" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Adjust the predictability and consistency of the AI agent's voice. Lower values allow larger deviations from the baseline voice, whether default or cloned. Setting this too high however can cause a monotone voice.

  Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="similarity" default="0.6" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Higher values will make speech differences between the selected voice and others more prominent. Extremely high values can cause voice distortion.

  Use lower values to lower the distinctiveness of the voice or eliminate unwanted audio static spikes.

  Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="speed" default="0.85" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.
  
  Note #2: Setting `reduce_latency` to `false` will cause this parameter to be ignored.

  How fast your agent talks! This parameter is simply a speech-speed multiplier, and works with fractional values such as `0.5` or large ones like `2`.

  Accepts decimal values between `0.1` and `5` (inclusive).
</ParamField>

  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="eng">
  Select a supported language of your choice. 
  Optimizes every part of our API for that language - transcription, speech, and other inner workings.
  
  Supported Languages and their codes:
  - English: ```eng```
  - Spanish: ```esp```
  - French:  ```fre```
  - Polish: ```pol```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="float or string (minutes)" default="30">
  Set the longest you want the call to possibly go in minutes. After the max_duration minutes have passed, the call will automatically end.
  
  Example Values: ```"45", "5.5", 20, 2.8```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="amd" type="boolean" default="false">
  AMD mode helps our AI navigate phone trees and IVR systems. If you know your call will hit an automated system you should switch it on. 
  
  NOTE: AMD mode causes increased delay for the first response, even if answered by a human. Highly recommended to set to `false` in the majority of cases.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="request_data" type="object">
  When you want your AI to "know" a specific fact - like the caller's
  name or other relevant context.

  The AI agent will be aware of both the key names as well as their corresponding values.

    <Accordion title="Sample">
        Example Issue: 
        - You're using a special data format, such as a code or abbreviation.
        - The Text-to-Speech engine pronounces the words as they're spelled, rather than how they're spoken.

        Example Solution:
        - Use `request_data` to specify the spoken form of that data.

        ```json
        "request_data": {
            "pronunciation_guide": {
                "BOS": "Boston",
                "JFK": "J F K Airport",
                "LAX": "L A X Airport"
            },
            // additional parameters as needed
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="array">
  Make dynamic requests to external APIs and use the data in your AI's responses.
 <Expandable title="properties">

  Each request object should contain:

  `url`: The URL of the external API to fetch data from.

  `response_data`: An array of objects describing how to parse and use the data fetched from the API. Explained in more detail below.

  The following are optional:

  `method`: Allows `GET` or `POST`. Default: `GET`

  `cache`: Whether to fetch the data once at the beginning of the call, or to re-check continuously for data that might change mid-call. Default: `true`

  `headers`: An object of headers to send with the request.

  `body`: The body of the request. 
  
  The following variables can be injected into the dynamic request body: 
  
  - `{{from}}` (Ex. `+12223334444`)
  - `{{to}}`
  - `{{short_from}}` (Ex. `2223334444`)
  - `{{short_to}}`
  - `{{call_id}}`
  
  These string values will be replaced in each `dynamic_data[].body` where they're used by system values in each request.

  Try out with this example:
```json
    "dynamic_data": [
        {
            "url": "https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json",
            "response_data": [
                {
                    "name": "BTC Price USD",
                    "data": "bpi.USD.rate",
                    "context": "Current BTC Price: ${{BTC Price USD}} USD"
                },
                {
                    "name": "BTC Price EUR",
                    "data": "bpi.EUR.rate",
                    "context": "In Euros: {{BTC Price USD}} EUR"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```
    <ParamField body="dynamic_data[i].response_data" type="array">
        An array of objects describing how to parse and use the data fetched from the API.

        Each object in this array should contain:
        - `name`: A label for the fetched data. 
        - Example: `"Flight Status"`
        - `data`: The JSON path in the API response to extract the data from. 
        - Example: `"user.flights[0].status"`
        - `context`: How this data should be incorporated into the AI's knowledge. 
        - Example: `"John's flight is currently {{Flight Status}}"`
    </ParamField>
 </Expandable>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" type="integer (milliseconds)" default={50}>
  When you increase the interruption latency, you force the AI phone agent to listen longer before responding. In practice, increasing the threshold results in less interruptions and more latency.

  Try setting the threshold to `500` milliseconds. You'll encounter higher latency, but you'll be interrupted much less frequently.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Can be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the call (present only if status is `success`).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "status": "success",
  "call_id": "9d404c1b-6a23-4426-953a-a52c392ff8f1"
}
```
