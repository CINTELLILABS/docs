description: "Send an AI phone call with a custom objective and actions."
---

## Overview

Send an AI phone call with a custom objective and actions. This endpoint can be used to create dynamic phone calls where the AI agent can follow instructions, use tools, and follow a conversation pathway.

---

## Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

<ParamField header="encrypted_key" type="string">
  A special key for using a BYOT (Bring Your Own Twilio) account. Only required for sending calls from your own Twilio account.
</ParamField>

---

## Body Parameters

<ParamField body="phone_number" type="string" required>
  The phone number to call. Must be a valid phone number in [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) format.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="from" type="string">
  Specify a phone number to call from that you own or have uploaded from your Twilio account. Country code is required, spaces or parentheses must be excluded.

  By default, calls are initiated from a separate pool of numbers owned by Bland. If you are using your own twilio numbers, you must specify a matching encryped_key in the create call request headers.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pathway_id" type="string">
  This is the pathway ID for the pathway you have created on our dev portal. You
  can access the ID of your pathways by clicking the 'Copy ID' button of your
  pathway [here](https://app.bland.ai/home?page=convo-pathways)

  Note: Certain parameters do not apply when using pathways.

  Example Simple Request body:

  ```json
  {
    "phone_number": "+1975934749",
    "pathway_id": "a0f0d4ed-f5f5-4f16-b3f9-22166594d7a7"
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="string" required>
  Note: Do not specify if using a pathway.

  Provide instructions, relevant information, and examples of the ideal conversation flow.

  This is your prompt where you are telling the agent what to do.

  Recommendations:

  - Include context and a background/persona for the agent like `"You are {name}, a customer service agent at {company} calling {name} about {reason}`.
  - Phrase instructions like you are speaking to the agent before the call.
  - Any time you tell the agent not to do something, provide an example of what they should do instead.
  - Keep the prompt under 2,000 characters where possible.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice" type="string">
  The voice of the AI agent to use. Accepts any form of voice ID, including custom voice clones and voice presets.

  Default voices can be referenced directly by their name instead of an id.

  Usage example: voice: "maya"

  Bland Curated voices:

  - Josh
  - Florian
  - Derek
  - June
  - Nat
  - Paige
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="background_track" type="string">
  Select an audio track that you'd like to play in the background during the call. The audio will play continuously when the agent isn't speaking, and is incorporated into it's speech as well.

  Use this to provide a more natural, seamless, engaging experience for the conversation. We’ve found this creates a significantly smoother call experience by minimizing the stark differences between total silence and the agent’s speech.

  Options:

  - null - Default, will play audible but quiet phone static.
  - office - Office-style soundscape. Includes faint typing, chatter, clicks, and other office sounds.
  - cafe - Cafe-like soundscape. Includes faint talking, clinking, and other cafe sounds.
  - restaurant - Similar to cafe, but more subtle.
  - none - Minimizes background noise
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="first_sentence" type="string">
  Makes your agent say a specific phrase or sentence for it's first response.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="wait_for_greeting" default="false" type="boolean">
  By default, the agent starts talking as soon as the call connects.

  When wait_for_greeting is set to true, the agent will wait for the call recipient to speak first before responding.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="block_interruptions" default="false" type="boolean">
  When set to `true`, the AI will not respond or process interruptions from the user.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="interruption_threshold" default="100" type="number">
  Adjusts how patient the AI is when waiting for the user to finish speaking.

  Lower values mean the AI will respond more quickly, while higher values mean the AI will wait longer before responding.

  Recommended range: 50-200
  •	50: Extremely quick, back and forth conversation
  •	100: Balanced to respond at a natural pace
  •	200: Very patient, allows for long pauses and interruptions. Ideal for collecting detailed information.

  Try to start with 100 and make small adjustments in increments of ~10 as needed for your use case.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="model" default="base" type="string">
  Select a model to use for your call.

  Options: `base` or `turbo`.

  In nearly all cases, `base` is the best choice.

  <Accordion title="Model Differences">
    There are two different ways to use Bland:

    - `model: base`
      - The original, follows scripts/procedures most effectively.
      - Supports all features and capabilities.
      - Best for Custom Tools
    - `model: turbo`
      - The absolute fastest latency possible, can be verbose at times
      - Limited capabilities currently (excludes Transferring, IVR navigation, Custom Tools)
      - Extremely realistic conversation capabilities
  </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="temperature" default={0.7} type="float">
  A value between 0 and 1 that controls the randomness of the LLM. 0 will cause more deterministic outputs while 1 will cause more random.

  Example Values: "0.9", "0.3", "0.5"
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="dynamic_data" type="object[]">
  Integrate data from external APIs into your agent's knowledge.

  Set to `null` or an empty string to clear dynamic data settings.

  ```json
    "dynamic_data": [
      {
        "url": "endpoint",
        "method": "GET",
        "body": [],
        "headers": [

          }
        ]
      }
    ],
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="keywords" default="[]" type="string[]">
  These words will be boosted in the transcription engine - recommended for proper nouns or words that are frequently mis-transcribed.

  For example, if the word Blandy is frequently transcribed as a homonym like “Reese” you could do this:

  ```json
    {
      "keywords": ["Blandy"]
    }
  ```

  For stronger keyword boosts, you can place a colon then a boost factor after the word. The default boost factor is 2.

  ```json
    {
      "keywords": ["Blandy:3"]
    }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="pronunciation_guide" type="array">
  The pronunciation guide is an `array` of `objects` that guides the agent on how to say specific words. This is great for situations with complicated terms or names.

  ```json
    [
      {
        "word": "example",
        "pronunciation": "ex-am-ple",
        "case_sensitive": "false",
        "spaced": "false"
    },
    {
      "word": "API",
      "pronunciation": "A P I",
      "case_sensitive": "true",
      "spaced": "true"
    }
  ]
  ```

  <Accordion title="Object Parameters">
    - `word`

    - `pronunciation`
      — the word you want to guide the LLM on how to pronounce.
    - `case_sensitive`
      — whether or not to consider case. Particularly useful with names. EG: 'Max' the name versus 'max' the word. Defaults to false. `Not required`.
    - `spaced`
      — whether or not to consider spaces. When `true` the word 'high' would be flagged but NOT 'hightop'. Defaults to true. `Not required`.
  </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_phone_number" type="string">
  A phone number that the agent can transfer to under specific conditions - such as being asked to speak to a human or supervisor. This option will be ignored for pathways.

  <Accordion title="Prompting Notes">
    For best results:

    - Specify conditions that the agent should transfer to a human under (examples are great\!)
    - In the `task`, refer to the action solely as "transfer" or "transferring".
    - Alternate phrasing such as "swap" or "switch" can mislead the agent, causing the action to be ignored.
  </Accordion>
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="transfer_list" type="object">
  Give your agent the ability to transfer calls to a set of phone numbers. This option will be ignored for pathways.

  Overrides transfer_phone_number if a transfer_list.default is specified.

<ParamField body="voicemail_message" type="string">
  When the AI encounters a voicemail, it will leave this message after the beep and then immediately end the call.

  Warning: If ivr_mode is set to true or voicemail_action is set to ignore, then this will still work for voicemails, but it will not hang up for IVR systems.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voicemail_action" default="hangup" type="enum">
  This is processed separately from the AI's decision making, and overrides it.

  Options:

  - hangup
  - leave_message
  - ignore

  Examples:

  - Call is answered by a voicemail (specifically with a beep or tone):
  - If voicemail_message is set, that message will be left and then the call will end.
  - Otherwise, the call immediately ends (regardless of ivr_mode)
  - Call is answered by an IVR system or phone tree:
  - If ivr_mode is set to true, the AI will navigate the system and continue as normal.
  - If voicemail_action is set to ignore, the AI will ignore the IVR and continue as normal.
  - Otherwise, if voicemail_message is set then it’ll leave that message and end the call.

      }
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" default="30" type="integer">
