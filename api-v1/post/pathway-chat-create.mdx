### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="pathway_id" type="string" required>
Pathway ID of the pathway to create a chat instance for.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="start_node_id" type="string">
The start node ID of the pathway. If not provided, the pathway will start from the node marked as the start node in the pathway configuration.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="request_data" type="object">
Custom key-value data to initialize the pathway chat with. This object will be stored as the pathway's initial variables and can be referenced within pathway nodes. The `request_data` must be a valid JSON object (not an array or null).

This works the same as [request_data in v1/calls](/api-v1/post/calls#param-request-data) where variables can be accessed using `{{variable_name}}` syntax within your pathway nodes.

```json
{
  "user_name": "John Doe",
  "account_id": "12345",
  "preference": "email"
}
```
</ParamField>
