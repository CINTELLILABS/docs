</ParamField>

### Body

<ParamField body="call_objects" type="array">
  A list of individual call objects to include in the batch. Each object follows the same schema as `/v1/calls`.

  ```json Example
  "call_objects": [
    {
      "phone_number": "+1234567890",
      "task": "Say hello to the nice person!",
  	"start_time": "2026-01-01 12:00:00-05:00",
      // Provide a UUID v7 Compliant ID for this Call ahead of time.
      // Requires entitlements to use. Contact your Account Executive for more information.
      "b_cid": "<UUID v7 Compliant ID>"
      // Remainder of /v1/call properties ...
    },
    {
      "phone_number": "+1234567891",
      "task": "Say hello to the bad person!",
      "record": false,
  	"start_time": "2026-01-01 1:00:00-05:00" //timezone is optional, defaults to UTC
      // /v1/call properties
    }
  ]
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="global" type="object" required>
  Global call properties to apply to all `call_objects`, unless overridden per entry. \
  \
  **Required keys:**

  - Must include at least one of: `"task"` or `"pathway_id"`. \
    \
    **Forbidden keys:**
  - `"phone_number"` is **not allowed** in the global object.

  Example:

  ```json Example
  "global": {
    "task": "Say hello to the nice person!",
    "record": true,
    "start_time": "2026-01-01 12:00:00-05:00" //timezone is optional, defaults to UTC
    // /v1/call properties
  }
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="status_webhook" type="string">
  Optional URL to receive batch status updates. We send a single POST per lifecycle phase and one final POST when the batch completes or fails. Payload is JSON with `batch_id`, `status`, and `timestamp`; final events include `calls_total` / `calls_successful` / `calls_failed` or `code` and `reason` on failure. Your endpoint should respond with 200 within a few seconds; we wait up to 10 seconds per call. See [Status webhook](#status-webhook) below for payload details.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  The response includes the `batch_id` of the newly created batch.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="data.batch_id" type="string">
  The unique identifier for the batch.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="errors" type="null">
  Always `null` on success.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseExample>

```json Response
{
  "data": {
    "batch_id": "8b8e8c57-9e6e-4e4d-84d2-9826b2268c22"
  },
  "errors": null
}
```

</ResponseExample>

### Status webhook

If you provide **`status_webhook`**, we POST to that URL at each lifecycle phase and once when the batch finishes. All requests use `Content-Type: application/json`.

**Status values:** `validating` | `dispatching` | `in_progress` | `in_progress_chunked` | `waiting_for_scheduled_calls` | `completed` | `failed` | `completed_partial`

**Common fields on every request:** `batch_id` (string), `status` (string), `timestamp` (ISO 8601). Progress events may include `message` (string). Final events include call counts or error details as below.

**Progress examples:**

```json Validating
{ "batch_id": "42eb41ed-1842-40c3-b2e6-47d690c179ad", "status": "validating", "timestamp": "2026-02-20T15:00:05.123Z" }
```

```json In progress (with message)
{ "batch_id": "42eb41ed-1842-40c3-b2e6-47d690c179ad", "status": "in_progress", "message": "Requested: 100. Validated: 100. Dispatched: 100. CPS: 12.50.", "timestamp": "2026-02-20T15:00:18.789Z" }
```

**Final events:**

```json Completed
{ "batch_id": "42eb41ed-1842-40c3-b2e6-47d690c179ad", "status": "completed", "calls_total": 100, "calls_successful": 98, "calls_failed": 2, "timestamp": "2026-02-20T15:30:00.000Z" }
```

```json Failed
{ "batch_id": "42eb41ed-1842-40c3-b2e6-47d690c179ad", "status": "failed", "code": "source_invalid", "reason": "Entry #7 did not have a phone number.", "timestamp": "2026-02-20T15:00:10.000Z" }
```

```json Completed partial (e.g. timeout)
{ "batch_id": "42eb41ed-1842-40c3-b2e6-47d690c179ad", "status": "completed_partial", "code": "batch_early_exit", "reason": "Condition not met within 86400 seconds", "calls_total": 50, "calls_successful": 45, "calls_failed": 5, "timestamp": "2026-02-21T15:00:00.000Z" }
```

We send one attempt per event with a 10-second timeout. If the request fails or times out, we log and continue; the workflow is not retried or failed. Respond with 2xx quickly and perform any heavy work asynchronously.
