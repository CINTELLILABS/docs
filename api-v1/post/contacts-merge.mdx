### Merge Behavior

When merging contacts:

- **Identifiers**: All phone numbers, emails, and external IDs from the duplicate are added to the primary contact
- **Metadata**: Metadata objects are merged, with primary contact values taking precedence for conflicting keys
- **Name**: The primary contact's name is kept, unless it's empty (then the duplicate's name is used)
- **Calls**: All calls associated with the duplicate are reassigned to the primary contact
- **SMS Conversations**: All SMS conversations are reassigned to the primary contact
- **Contact Memory**: Memory data is merged (facts, recent messages, summaries) for each persona/agent. If both contacts have memory for the same persona, the data is intelligently combined
