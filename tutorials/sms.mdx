# Introduction

Messaging lets you create a personal contact that users can call and text. Use the same phone numbers for voice and SMS (and RCS when enabled), with one place to manage conversations and pathways.

<Info>
  **Enterprise feature** — Messaging (SMS and RCS) is available on Enterprise plans. Contact your Account Executive or [reach out to sales](https://forms.default.com/361589) for access.
</Info>

- **Pathway-driven replies** — Prompts with backchanneling and pauses are automatically stripped from messages so replies stay clean and professional.
- **Conversation lifecycle** — When a conversation ends, the agent stops responding. Restart by deleting the conversation or its messages in the [messaging dashboard](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/sms), then start a new thread.
- **Pricing** — Each SMS message is [billed at $0.02](/platform/billing#sms-billing) (inbound and outbound).

## RCS (Rich Communication Services)

Bland supports **RCS** so you can deliver rich, interactive messages—verified business profiles, suggested replies, action buttons, cards, and media—using the **same APIs and endpoints** as SMS. No separate integration is required.

- **Same endpoints as SMS** — Use the same send/receive and conversation endpoints; if your number has an RCS profile set up (via your Messaging Service), Bland automatically defaults to RCS when the recipient supports it.
- **Automatic content templates** — We generate RCS content templates from your pathways and conversation flow: quick replies, action buttons, and rich cards are derived from your node logic and messaging context so replies stay on-brand and on-path.

If you're interested in enabling RCS for your numbers, contact your **Account Executive** to get set up.

**What RCS looks like**

An RCS conversation can show a verified business profile, structured messages, and tap-to-reply options; your business profile can display verification and contact details.

### Quick start

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Attach a pathway" icon="route" href="https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/sms">
    On the Messaging dashboard, configure a number with a pathway (or clone from a voice pathway). Inbound messages follow your pathway logic and your agent replies automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Send via API" icon="code" href="/api-v1/post/sms-send">
    Use [Send SMS](/api-v1/post/sms-send) to send a message or start a conversation, or [Create conversation](/api-v1/post/sms-create) to create or resume with a specific pathway. Same endpoints for SMS and RCS.

# How to create a messaging contact

Visit the [Messaging page](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/sms) and click **Configure SMS for Phone Numbers**.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/sms_dashboard.png" alt="Messaging dashboard with Configure SMS for Phone Numbers" />


Click any phone number you own, then click **Setup SMS**.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/phone_num_setup.png" alt="Phone number Setup SMS option" />

You can set up a number with either a prompt or a pathway, similar to configuring your phone number for inbound calls.

Once saved, a toast appears so you can receive a test SMS from the number.

<Tip>
  **First-time setup** — New numbers can take a few minutes to be added to the carrier's registry. If you don't receive a test SMS right away, wait a few minutes and try again.
</Tip>

You can manage your messaging conversations from the dashboard.

## Using an existing voice pathway for messaging

If you have an existing voice pathway and want a similar setup for messaging, create an SMS pathway by cloning from that pathway's page: click **Clone current pathway**.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/sms_pathway.png" alt="Clone current pathway for SMS" />


To link an inbound number to your SMS pathway, click **Set Inbound Number to SMS Pathway**.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/inbound_dropdown.png" alt="Set Inbound Number to SMS Pathway" />



When testing your SMS pathway, send a test SMS to the number and view pathway logs from the pathway page—iterate the same way you would for a voice pathway.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/pathway_ui.png" alt="Pathway logs for SMS testing" />




## Merging changes between voice and SMS pathways

If you change your voice pathway and want those changes in your SMS pathway (or the other way around), you can merge them.

Click the **Sync** button.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/sync.png" alt="Sync button to merge pathways" />


A modal opens so you can select the pathway to merge from.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/merge/compare.png" alt="Compare pathways to merge" />

You can see the differences between the two pathways and choose the SMS pathway, the voice pathway, or a custom edit for the node, pathway label, or global prompt.

You can resolve conflicts for:

**Global prompts**

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/merge/globalprompt.png" alt="Merge global prompt conflict" />


**Nodes**

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/merge/node.png" alt="Merge node conflict" />

**Pathway labels**

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/merge/pathwaylabel.png" alt="Merge pathway label conflict" />

Finally, review the summary of changes that will be applied.


<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", boxShadow: "0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/sms-images/merge/summary.png" alt="Merge summary" />

After you confirm, the changes are applied so you can keep your SMS and voice pathways in sync.



## BYOT & A2P

In the United States, all phone numbers used for SMS must be registered with an A2P (Application to Person) campaign.

Each number must be linked to a Twilio Messaging Service SID to send and receive SMS. Numbers purchased from Bland are linked to a Messaging Service SID automatically.

For bring-your-own (BYOT) numbers, the ability to set up your own A2P campaign in Bland is coming soon. Until then, set up your A2P campaign with Twilio and pass the Messaging Service SID when configuring your SMS number in Bland.



## API reference

Use these endpoints to send messages, manage conversations, and configure numbers. All work for both SMS and RCS.
