## Introduction

Memory lets Bland agents remember people across conversations—calls, SMS, and other channels—so interactions feel continuous and personalized. When someone reaches out again, your assistant already has context: who they are, what was discussed, and what’s left to do.

## How it works

1. **Enable memory** on a [pathway](/tutorials/personas) or persona (in the dashboard or via the API).
2. **Bland creates contacts automatically** when someone interacts—matched by phone number, email, or external ID.
3. **For each contact, Bland maintains:**
   - **Facts** — Structured information (name, preferences, account details, etc.)
   - **Summary** — A rolling summary of past conversations for LLM context
   - **Open items** — Action items or follow-ups (e.g. “Send prescription refill”, “Call back Friday”)
   - **Entities** — Tracked things like orders, appointments, or tickets when you use entity schemas
   - **Recent messages** — A sliding window of the latest exchange for handoffs and continuity

Memory is scoped **per contact and per persona** (or per agent number). So one person can have separate conversation histories with different agents or campaigns, and each stays consistent over time.

## Enabling memory on a pathway or persona

### Pathways

To enable memory for a **pathway**:

1. Open your pathway in the Bland dashboard.
2. In the top-right menu (next to **Send Call**), open the dropdown.
3. Check **Enable Memory** — "Remember previous conversations across all calls per user."
4. Save your pathway. From the next interaction onward, Bland will create and update contacts and their memory for that pathway.

### Personas

To enable memory for a **persona**, go to the **Knowledge** tab for that persona and toggle **Memory** on.

Calls or conversations that use that pathway or persona will then automatically read and update the contact’s facts, summary, open items, and recent messages. No need to pass IDs or manage stores in your API calls for basic use.

To enable or disable memory **per pathway or persona version** (e.g. for testing a specific version), use the [Enable memory](/api-v1/post/memory-enable) API with `pathway_id` + `version_number` or `persona_id` + `version_id`, and `memory_enabled`.

<Note>
Cross-channel memory (same contact across voice and SMS) requires the `cross_channel_memory` feature. Contact support to request access.

## Viewing memory after a call

After a call (or SMS conversation) with memory enabled, Bland captures contact facts and entities from the interaction. You can view this in **Call Logs** (open a completed call and select the **MEMORY** tab) or in **SMS** logs under the **SMS** tab for that conversation.

Memory works **cross-channel** between calls and SMS: the same contact’s context is shared across voice and text. That allows hand-offs (e.g. from a call to follow-up SMS, or vice versa) and multiple touchpoints while keeping one coherent view of the contact.

The MEMORY tab shows:

- **Memory context** — What Bland had available for that conversation.
- **Changes made** — Contact facts (e.g. customer name, phone) and **entities** (e.g. appointments: date, time, service type) that were added or updated from the call or conversation.

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem", marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }} src="/tutorials/tutorials-assets/memory/MemoryCallLog.jpeg" alt="Call log MEMORY tab showing contact facts and appointment entities for a completed call" />

For example, after a call with a customer named Joe who scheduled a roofing inspection, the call log’s (or SMS conversation’s) MEMORY tab might show contact facts like "Customer Name: Joe" and "Customer Phone: 816-500-7458", and entities such as "Appointment Inspection" with date, time, and service type. **Bland automatically retrieves this memory for subsequent interactions** with that contact—whether they're calls or SMS—so the assistant can reference what was already discussed and what's scheduled.

## Managing contacts and memory stores

Use the [Memory Stores](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/memory) page in your Bland workspace to:

- See all contacts and their memory (summaries, facts, interaction history).
- Search and filter by phone number, summary, or agent.
- Inspect or edit summaries and metadata when needed.

Memory is organized by contact; each contact can have multiple “memories” (one per persona or agent number they’ve interacted with).

## Real-world example

Imagine a company running two separate flows:

- **Appointment scheduling** — Bland helps contacts book and reschedule appointments (inspections, consultations, follow-ups).
- **Support** — Bland handles open tickets, status updates, and troubleshooting.

With **memory enabled per pathway or persona**, each flow keeps its own context for the same contact. The scheduling assistant remembers upcoming appointments and preferences; the support assistant remembers ticket details and resolution history—without mixing the two. The same person can have one conversation about booking and another about a support issue, each with the right context.

## API and programmatic access

For building custom flows or reading/writing memory programmatically, use the [Contacts API](/api-v1/get/contacts) to list and manage contacts, and the memory endpoints to get or update context, summary, facts, and messages for a contact and persona (or agent). See the [Memory API reference](/api-v1/get/memory) for the full list of endpoints.

No need to pass or manage memory store IDs for normal use—enable memory on your pathway or persona and Bland handles the rest.
