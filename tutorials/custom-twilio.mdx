## Overview

Users can connect their own Twilio account to Bland. Easily bring over your existing phone numbers, integrations, and more.

Pre-requisites:
- Your own Twilio account

## Step 1: Creating an Encrypted Key with your Twilio Credentials

1. Go to your [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) and get your Account SID and Auth Token.
2. Create an `encrypted_key` by:
    - [Sending an API request](/api-v1/post/accounts) to Bland. 
    - Going to the BYOT page in the [Bland Dashboard](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/add-ons) and clicking "Generate New Key"

This is the only time that your `encrypted_key` will be returned to you. Make sure to store it securely, and new keys will need to be generated if lost.

## Step 2: Using the Encrypted Key in Outbound Calls

Include `encrypted_key` in the body (in addition to the `Authorization` header) of your API requests, and we'll use that account's credentials to make the call.

For example:

```bash
curl --location 'https://api.bland.ai/v1/calls' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'Authorization: [YOUR_BLAND_API_KEY]' \
--data '{
  "from": "+1234567890",
  "phone_number": "+10987654321",
  "encrypted_key": "[YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY]",
  "task": "Ask the user how their day is going"
}
```

Note: 
- You can set your `from` number in the API request - this will need to be a number owned by that Twilio account (and not one purchased through Bland).
- By default, we'll send calls from a randomly selected number in the specified Twilio account if a `from` is not specified.

## Step 3: Importing Inbound numbers

1. Your numbers imported from your Twilio account will appear on the [Add-ons page](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/add-ons) under "BYOT" (Bring Your Own Twilio).
2. From there, you can select specific numbers to import into your Bland account by [sending an API request](/api-v1/post/inbound-insert) or selecting the specific numbers and importing them through the dashboard.
3. Once imported, these numbers can be used for both inbound and outbound calls through Bland's infrastructure.


## Step 4: Configuring Inbound Numbers/Webhooks

Note: When updating inbound numbers, the headers need to include the `encrypted_key` in addition to the `Authorization` header. Doing so makes sure the updates are applied to the correct Twilio account.

Once you update an inbound number through the [Dev Portal](https://app.bland.ai) or [API](/api-v1/post/inbound-number-update), that number will be automatically configured to run on Bland's infrastructure. No additional steps are required!
