## Introduction

The webhook node enables outbound API requests to external services during a live call. It can be used to retrieve data, trigger workflows, or pass information to third-party systems.

To add a webhook node:

* Open your pathway
* Click **New Node** in the top left
* Select the **Webhook** icon

---

## Node Configuration

Once added to your pathway, the webhook node includes several configuration options:

### 1. Node Name

* Assign a unique name to help identify the webhook's purpose.

### 2. Extract Call Info into Variables

* When enabled, this mirrors the variable extraction behavior from previous nodes.
* Variables captured earlier in the call will be passed into the webhook context.

### 3. Webhook Configuration

This section defines how the outbound request is sent:

* **Request Type**: Choose HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
* **URL**: Endpoint of the external service
* **Authorization**: Enable and configure token or basic auth if required
* **Headers**: Add key-value pairs for custom headers
* **Body**: Compose payload for POST or PUT requests

### 4. Advanced Settings

* **Timeout**: Maximum wait time before considering the request failed
* **Retries**: Number of retry attempts on failure
* **Reroute through server**: Rerouting through the server helps prevent CORS issues. Disable only if you're experiencing problems with the rerouted requests.
* **Test API Request**: Send a live test request and view raw response or errors

---

## Response Data Mapping

If the webhook returns a JSON response, you can extract specific values into variables for use in subsequent nodes:

* Enable **Response Data**
* For each value to extract:

  * Define a **Variable Name** (single string, e.g. `user_id`)
  * Provide the **JSON Path** (e.g. `$.data.id`)
  * Optionally add a **Description** for additional context

---

## Pathway Routing After Response

Define where to route the agent based on the webhook result:

* This allows conditional routing based on status codes or outcomes.
* Example: route to different nodes if response status is 200 vs. 500.

---

## Speech During Webhook

Enable the agent to speak while the webhook is processing:

* Useful for avoiding awkward silences during longer API requests
* Example speech: *"One moment while I look up your information."*
* This speech can be static text or AI-generated based on prompting.

---

## Summary

Webhook nodes are a flexible way to integrate real-time external logic into your pathways. With full support for request setup, variable extraction, conditional routing, and speech, they offer a robust tool for dynamic agent workflows.
