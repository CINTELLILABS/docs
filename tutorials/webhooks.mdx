## Introduction

The webhook node enables outbound API requests to external services during a live call. It can be used to retrieve data, trigger workflows, or pass information to third-party systems.

To add a webhook node:

* Open your pathway
* Click **New Node** in the top left
* Select the **Webhook** icon

---

## Node Configuration

Once added to your pathway, the webhook node includes several configuration options:

### 1. Extract Call Info into Variables

* When enabled, this mirrors the variable extraction behavior found in other default nodes.
* Based on the conversation up until the point of this node, variables will be extracted based on their name and description.

  style={{ width: "100%", borderRadius: "0.5rem", marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}
  alt="Webhook Node Extract"
/>

In the above example, the variables `user_name` and `user_interested` are being extracted from the conversation. Up until this node, the objective was given to the agent to discuss the user's basic information and their availability. Based on what was discussed, the agent will extract the user's name, along with a True or False value based on whether the user is interested in a follow up meeting.

These variables can then be included in the webhook. Here is an example body:

```json
{
  "name": "{{user_name}}",
  "interested": "{{user_interested}}"
}
```


### 2. Webhook Configuration

This section defines how the outbound request is sent:

* **Request Type**: Choose HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
* **URL**: Endpoint of the external service
* **Authorization**: Enable and configure token or basic auth if required
* **Headers**: Add key-value pairs for custom headers
* **Body**: Compose payload for POST or PUT requests

### 3. Advanced Settings

* **Timeout**: Maximum wait time before considering the request failed
* **Retries**: Number of retry attempts on failure
* **Reroute through server**: Rerouting through the server helps prevent CORS issues. Disable only if you're experiencing problems with the rerouted requests.
* **Test API Request**: Send a live test request and view raw response or errors

---

## Response Data Mapping

If the webhook returns a JSON response, you can extract specific values into variables for use in subsequent nodes:

* Enable **Response Data**
* For each value to extract:

  * Define a **Variable Name** (single string, e.g. `user_id`)
  * Provide the **JSON Path** (e.g. `$.data.id`)
  * Optionally add a **Description** for additional context

---

## Pathway Routing After Response

Define where to route the agent based on the webhook result:

* This allows conditional routing based on status codes or outcomes.
* Example: route to different nodes if response status is 200 vs. 500.

---

## Speech During Webhook

Enable the agent to speak while the webhook is processing:

* Useful for avoiding awkward silences during longer API requests
* Example speech: *"One moment while I look up your information."*
* This speech can be static text or AI-generated based on prompting.
