## Introduction

Custom tools allow your agent to interact with any web API mid-call. Do things like:

  <Card title="Create a support ticket" icon="ticket">
    Generate support tickets in your issue tracker.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update your CRM" icon="database">
    Update your CRM with relevant details during the call.

## Background
To understand how custom tools work, let's take a peek under the hood of the Bland AI phone agent.

During the conversation, the phone agent is constantly listening to figure out when it's supposed to respond. When the phone agent realizes it's time to respond, it reviews the tools in its toolbox and picks between them.

Those tools include a `speak`, `wait`, and `button press` tool. When you create a custom tool, you add it to the existing 'toolbox' for the phone agent to pick from.

A few natural questions arise:
1. How do I define my custom tool?
2. How do I make sure my tool gets picked at the right time?
3. How does information from the call get passed to my custom tool's API request?
4. How do I fill the silence (when my custom tool is running)?
5. How does the response from my custom tool get added to the call?

# Creating your custom tool

## Defining the API request
Imagine you're creating an AI phone agent to take restaurant orders. You want your phone agent to have the ability to place orders, by pinging your backend API.

Here's what that request might look like:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.your-restaurant.com/orders",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": {
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "burger",
        "patties": 2,
        "quantity": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "fry",
        "size": "lg",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## From API request to custom tool

The next step is to convert the API request into a custom tool. Custom tools have the following properties:
- `name` - the agent will see this in the list of tools
- `description` - a short explanation of what the tool does
- `input_schema` - a JSON schema describing the input data
- `speech` (optional) - a string that will be spoken to the agent while your tool waits for a response
- `response_data` - An array of objects that describe how to extract data from the response. Within the response data, you can create variables that the phone agent can reference in its prompt.

### Name & Description
The agent will see the name in the list of tools. The name, plus the description, help the AI phone agent when it decides which tool to use.

For this example we'll set the name to `PlaceOrder`, and the description to `Places the final order for the drive thru`.

### Input Schema
The input schema is critical. It defines the shape of the API request, the different inputs the request can take, and also includes an example (which helps our system when creating requests).

Here's what the input schema could look like:

```json
"input_schema": {
    "example": {
        "items": [
            {
                "name": "burger",
                "patties": 2,
                "quantity": 3
            },
            {
                "name": "fry",
                "size": "lg",
                "quantity": 2
            }
        ]
    },
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "items": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "name": {
                        "type": "string"
                    },
                    "patties": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    },
                    "size": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": [
                            "sm",
                            "md",
                            "lg"
                        ]
                    },
                    "flavor": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": [
                            "chocolate",
                            "strawberry",
                            "vanilla"
                        ],
                        "default": "vanilla"
                    },
                    "quantity": {
                        "type": "integer"
                    }
                },
                "required": [
                    "name",
                    "quantity"
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Two important notes about input schema:
1. `input_schema` is converted into the variable `"{{input}}"` that you can use in the request body/query/headers
2. To access nested properties, use dot notation: `"{{input.property.subproperty}}"`

Scroll down to see the full example.

### Speech
Because requesting external APIs might take a while, we enable you to define a `speech` property. The phone agent will say the `speech` while it makes the request.

An example speech might look like: `Perfect, I'll schedule that right now, give me just a second.`

For the restaurant ordering example, the speech could be `Thank you, placing that order now.`

### Response data
Once your API request comes back, you need to extract the response data, and then make the phone agent aware of the new information.

The `data` field determines how you extract the data while the `name` field determines the variable name for reference in the prompt.

Here's an example response data:

```json
"response_data": [
    {
        "name": "order_price",
        "data": "$.price"
    }
]
```

## Full example

Below is the entire API request for sending a phone call using the outlined custom tool:

```json
{
    "phone_number": "...",
    // note that the returned value ({{order_price}}) in the task is populated only after the tool is run
    "task": "You are taking a drive thru order from a customer. Find out everything that they want like a drive thru cashier. Continue until they say they're done. Repeat the full order back to them after that, and ask if that's correct. If they confirm that it's correct, then and only then will you place their order using the PlaceOrder tool. After you place it, tell them their order total and to pull forward. Their order price is {{order_price}}",
    "first_sentence": "Hi, what can I get started for you today?",
    "request_data": {
        "menu": {
            "burger": [
                "patties"
            ],

                "flavor",

            ]
        }
    },
