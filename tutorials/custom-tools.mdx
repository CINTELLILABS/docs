## Introduction

Custom tools allow your agent to interact with any web API mid-call. 

Do things like:
- Send emails or SMS messages
- Create support tickets
- Schedule appointments
- Anything that has an API (so basically anything!)

## Quick reference
- Set the `tools` property in a call request or while updating an inbound agent's details
- `tools` is an array of [Dynamic Data](/tutorials/dynamic-data) objects that each define their own API request
- In addition, specify a `name`, `description`, and `input_schema` property
- To say a message while the tool is running, specify a `speech` property
- `input_schema` is converted into the variable `"{{input}}"` that you can use in the request body/query/headers
- To access nested properties, use dot notation: `"{{input.property.subproperty}}"`

## Getting Started

Custom tools are based on the same concepts as Dynamic Data, so if you haven't already, read through the [Dynamic Data](/tutorials/dynamic-data) section to build some familiarity.

Start with the base api request that you want to make. 

Let's say your drive-thru restaurant uses Bland to take orders - and you want to place the customer's order during the call.

A request might look like this in axios or fetch:

```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.your-restaurant.com/orders",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
  },
  "body": {
    "items": [
      {
        "name": "burger",
        "patties": 2,
        "quantity": 1
      },
      {
        "name": "fry",
        "size": "lg",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

We'll use this as the basis for our custom tool.

## Creating a Custom Tool

Requirements for tools:
- Inherited from Dynamic Data
- `name` property - the agent will see this in the list of tools
- `description` property - a short explanation of what the tool does
- `input_schema` property - a JSON schema describing the input data
- `speech` (optional) - a string that will be spoken to the agent while your tool waits for a response

Let's add those here:

```json
{
    "name": "PlaceOrder",
    "description": "Places the final order for the drive thru.",
    "speech": "Thank you, placing that order now.",
    "input_schema": {
        "example": {
            "items": [
                {
                    "name": "burger",
                    "patties": 2,
                    "quantity": 3
                },
                {
                    "name": "fry",
                    "size": "lg",
                    "quantity": 2
                }
            ]
        },
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "items": {
                "type": "array",
                "items": {
                    "type": "object",
                    "properties": {
                        "name": {
                            "type": "string"
                        },
                        "patties": {
                            "type": "integer"
                        },
                        "size": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": [
                                "sm",
                                "md",
                                "lg"
                            ]
                        },
                        "flavor": {
                            "type": "string",
                            "enum": [
                                "chocolate",
                                "strawberry",
                                "vanilla"
                            ],
                            "default": "vanilla"
                        },
                        "quantity": {
                            "type": "integer"
                        }
                    },
                    "required": [
                        "name",
                        "quantity"
                    ]
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "url": "https://api.your-restaurant.com/orders",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": "Bearer ..."
    },
    "body": {
        "items": "{{input.items}}" // note that this starts with {{input}} - this is how you access the input data
    },
    "response_data": [
        {
            "name": "order_price",
            "data": "$.price"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `response_data` property is an array of objects that describe how to extract data from the response. Once they're extracted, the agent will be aware of them and can use them in the call flow.

Here's what a full request that follows a procedure could look like:

```json
{
    "phone_number": "...",
    // note that the returned value ({{order_price}}) in the task is populated only after the tool is run
    "task": "You are taking a drive thru order from a customer. Find out everything that they want like a drive thru cashier. Continue until they say they're done. Repeat the full order back to them after that, and ask if that's correct. If they confirm that it's correct, then and only then will you place their order using the PlaceOrder tool. After you place it, tell them their order total and to pull forward. Their order price is {{order_price}}",
    "first_sentence": "Hi, what can I get started for you today?",
    "request_data": {
        "menu": {
            "burger": [
                "patties"
            ],
            "fry": [
                "size"
            ],
            "shake": [
                "flavor",
                "size"
            ]
        }
    },
    "tools": [
        {
            "name": "PlaceOrder",
            "description": "Places the final order for the drive thru.",

                            "patties": 2,
                            "quantity": 3
                        },

                        }
                    ]
                },
