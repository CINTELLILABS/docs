## Introduction

Conversational pathways are our new way of prompting Bland that has led to major breakthroughs in realism.

# Terminologies

To understand how pathways work, let's first understand the terminologies.

## Nodes

These blocks you see here are called Nodes.

## Pathways

Each of these dotted lines is called a Pathway. Their start end end points are the `Purple Circles` on the top and bottom of the nodes.

In order to create a pathway from a node, you would click on the purple circle at the bottom of the node and drag your mouse to connect to the top purple circle another node.

Upon doing so, you will now have a new dotted line connecting the two nodes, with a 'New Pathway' button in the middle of the line.

In order to instruct the agent when to take this pathway, you would click on the Edit icon on the 'New Pathway' button, and input the conditions for when the agent should take this pathway. In the above example, the agent would take this pathway if the user is not available to talk, so I labelled the pathway as 'not a good time to talk'.

And there you have it! You have now created a pathway from one node to another, and instructed the agent when to take this pathway. You can connect as many nodes as you want in this manner, and create as many pathways as you want. In order to create a new Node, press the 'Add new Node' button at the top-left of the screen.


# Node Types


There are currently 5 different types of Nodes
- Default 
- Webhook
- Knowledge Base
- End Call 
- Transfer Call

You can select the type of node you want by clicking on the dropdown of `Node Type`.


## Base/Default Node (Important!)

The default node provides the ability to generate a response to the user. This functionality is exposed to all other nodes as well.

You can either:
- Use the `Prompt` field to give instructions on what the agent should do at this point in the conversation. This is the recommended way to generate responses as it makes the conversation more human and natural. 
- Enable the 'Static Text' toggle to provide a fixed response, and the agent will always say the same thing at this point in the conversation.

### Optional Decision Guide

The optional decision guide is only to be used if your phone agent currently is not going down the correct pathway. We do not expect this to happen often, but still want to provide you the tools to handle these issues if they arise. 

It is a way to provide the phone agent with example scenarios of what the user might say, and what pathway the agent should take in response.

You would put in examples of what the user might say in the `User Input` field, and then in the `Pathway` field, you would provide the pathway the agent should take in response.




## Transfer Call Node

The transfer call node is used to transfer the call to another number when the node is reached, and the dialogue at this node is complete. 

As such, you may have the agent say any final words before the call is transferred. 

<img style={{ borderRadius: "0.5rem" }} src="/tutorials/transfer_node.png" />


## End Call Node

The end call node will end the call when the node is reached, and the dialogue at this node is complete.

As such, you may have the agent say any final words before the call is ended.

## Knowledge Base Node

The knowledge base node is used to connect your agent to a knowledge base, to answer any questions the user has.

Paste in any text in the 'Knowledge Base' field, and the agent will search through the knowledge base to answer the user.

## Webhook Node

The webhook node is used to execute webhooks at any point during the conversation, and send speech during/after the webhook.

`Webhook Information` is all you need in order to execute a webhook, and works the same way as Dynamic Data. Refer to the [Dynamic Data](http://localhost:3001/tutorials/dynamic-data) section for more information...

Similar to how the dialogue is handled in all other nodes, you can control the dialogue sent before, and after the webhook is executed.

Variables received from the webhook can be used in the dialogue as well, as shown in the example below.
