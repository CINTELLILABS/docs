### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string">
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>
### Body

<ParamField body="phone_number" type="string" required>
  This is the phone number of the person or company you want to call. -
  International numbers: must include the country code and may not include
  additional formatting (like parentheses and dashes). E.g. '+447700900077'. -
  U.S. numbers: may include formatting, but we recommend stripping all
  additional characters.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="task" type="string" required>
  Define how the AI should behave. Provide the AI context about the interaction, and give it instructions.

Note: you should continually test and iterate prompts to get the best output from your AI.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="reduce_latency" type="boolean" default="true">
  Reducing latency means that the agent will generate responses more quickly and have less of a delay. This must be set to ```true``` when using Voice Clones.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_id" type="number" default="0">
  When reduce latency is set to `false`:
  - 0: American female (southern accent)
  - 1: American male 
  - 2: British female 
  - 3: Indian male

  When reduce latency is set to `true`:
  - 0: American male
  - 1: Australian female
  - 2: American female
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="eng">
  Select a supported language of your choice. 
  Optimizes every part of our API for that language - transcription, speech, and other inner workings.
  
  Supported Languages and their codes:
  - English: ```eng```
  - Spanish: ```esp```
  - French:  ```fre```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="request_data" type="object">
  When you want your AI to "know" a specific fact - like the caller's
  name or other relevant context.

  The AI agent will be aware of both the key names as well as their corresponding values.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id
  and transcript to this URL after the call completes. This can be useful if you
  want to have real time notifications when calls finish.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="float or string" default="30">
  Set the longest you want the call to possibly go in minutes. After the max_duration minutes have passed, the call will automatically end.
  
  Example Values: ```"45", "5.5", 20, 2.8```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="amd" type="boolean" default="false">
  AMD mode helps our AI navigate phone trees and IVR systems. If you know your call will hit an automated system you should switch it on. 
  
  HOWEVER: AMD mode also causes increases latency. It will cause worse performance when speaking with normal people. You should defualt to switching it off.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="wait_for_greeting" type="boolean" default="false">
  Makes the AI wait to speak until after speech is detected. 
  
  Creates more realistic conversations when answered with "Hello?", "This is \{name\} speaking." and so on.
  
  - When ```false```: The AI starts speaking shortly after the call is answered. 
  
  - When ```true```: The AI will wait for the answerer to speak.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="optimize_for" type="enum/string">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Note #2: As we receive feedback, this parameter may be adjusted to perform in the best manner possible.

  Adjusts several voice settings at once with a template. 
  
  `quality` optimizations will produce a clearer, more expressive voice at the expense of slightly slower response times.

  `speed` optimizations lead to faster responses and potentially less realistic speech.

  Accepts the following values: `"quality_max"`, `"quality"`, `"speed"`, `"speed_max"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="stability" default="0.8" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Adjust the predictability and consistency of the AI agent's voice. Lower values allow larger deviations from the baseline voice, whether default or cloned. Setting this too high however can cause a monotone voice.

  Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="similarity" default="0.6" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.

  Higher values will make speech differences between the selected voice and others more prominent. Extremely high values can cause voice distortion.

  Use lower values to lower the distinctiveness of the voice or eliminate unwanted audio static spikes.

  Accepts decimal values between `0` and `1` (inclusive)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="seed" type="integer">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.
  
  Note #2: Setting `reduce_latency` to `false` will cause this parameter to be ignored.

  By default, the audio for each sentence and word is generated with a random seed and may pronounce the same exact words/sentences with slight variations.

  Setting the `seed` parameter to any integer will make the audio/enunciation deterministic and repeatable. This is most useful for particularly intricate or tricky words that you want to guarantee will be pronounced correctly.
  
  Accepts integer values between `0` and `1000` (inclusive)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="speed" default="0.85" type="float">
  Note: This is an experimental parameter and may behave unexpectedly.
  
  Note #2: Setting `reduce_latency` to `false` will cause this parameter to be ignored.

  How fast your agent talks! This parameter is simply a speech-speed multiplier, and works with fractional values such as `0.5` or large ones like `2`.

  Accepts decimal values between `0.1` and `5` (inclusive)
</ParamField>
  

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Can be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the call (present only if status is `success`)
</ResponseField>
