### Headers

<ParamField header="authorization" type="string">
  Your API key for authentication.
</ParamField>
### Body

<ParamField body="base_prompt" type="string" required>
  This is the prompt or task used for all the phone calls in the request. Information can be inserted into it surrounding variable names with \{\{curly braces\}\}.

  Example: 
  ```json
  "You are calling {{business}} to renew their subscription to {{service}} before it expires on {{date}}."
  ```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="call_data" type="array" required>
  Define a list of calls to make and their properties. Each call in call_data MUST have a "phone_number" property. Properties are case-sensitive.

  Example:
    ```json
[
    {   
        "phone_number": "1234567890",
        "business": "ABC co.",
        "service": "Netflix",
        "date": "September 4th"
    },
    {
        "phone_number": "32176540987",
        "business": "XYZ inc.",
        "service": "Window Cleaning",
        "date": "December 20th"
    },
    //...
]
```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="label" type="string">
  Adds a user-friendly label to your batch to keep track of it's original intention. This can help differentiate multiple call batches that are part of the same Campaign. Shown when a batch is retreived.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="campaign_id" type="string">
  Use ```campaign_id``` to organize related batches together. This can be set manually or auto-generated through Campaigns. 
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="test_mode" type="boolean" default="false">
  When this is set to ```true```, only the first call of ```call_data``` will be dispatched. A common use case is to set the first ```phone_number``` value to your own to confirm everything's set up properly.

  Includes additional information in the response when true so that it's easier to find any issues.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="batch_id" type="string" default="auto-generated">
  If you'd like, you can set a batch_id value manually. We made it auto-generate so that you don't have to keep track of batch_id values you've already used.

  Situations where this comes in handy could be retrying specific calls and keeping consolidated analytics information, as an alternative to ```campaign_id```.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="reduce_latency" type="boolean" default="true">
  Reducing latency means that the agent will generate responses more quickly and have less of a delay. This must be set to ```true``` when using Voice Clones.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="voice_id" type="number" default="0">
  When reduce latency is set to `false`, we offer the following voices: 
  - 0: American female 
  - 1: American male 
  - 2: British female 
  - 3: Indian male 

  When reduce latency is set to `true`, we offer only one default voice: 
  - 0: American female
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="language" type="string" default="eng">
  Select a supported language of your choice. 
  Optimizes every part of our API for that language - transcription, speech, and other inner workings.
  
  Supported Languages and their codes:
  - English: ```eng```
  - Spanish: ```esp```
  - French:  ```fre```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="request_data" type="object">
  When you want your AI to "know" a specific fact - like the caller's
  name or other relevant context.

  The AI agent will be aware of both the key names as well as their corresponding values.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhook" type="string">
  The webhook should be a http / https callback url. We will send the call_id
  and transcript to this URL after the call completes. This can be useful if you
  want to have real time notifications when calls finish.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="max_duration" type="float or string" default="30">
  Set the longest you want the call to possibly go in minutes. After max_duration minutes have passed, the call will automatically end.
  
  Example Values: ```"45", "5.5", 20, 2.8```
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="amd" type="boolean" default="false">
  If you want the AI to navigate a phone tree (like calling insurance or banks) or want the AI to leave voicemails, set `amd` to true.

Otherwise, if you're calling a human and need quicker response times for the first reply, set `amd` to false.

Functionally: We use ML to detect if we are talking to a human or machine. If we detect a machine theres an additional 1.3 second delay in between replies.

</ParamField>

<ParamField body="wait_for_greeting" type="boolean" default="false">
  Makes the AI wait to speak until after speech is detected. 
  
  Creates more realistic conversations when answered with "Hello?", "This is \{name\} speaking." and so on.
  
  - When ```false```: The AI starts speaking very shortly after the call is answered. 
  
  - When ```true```: The AI will wait for the answerer to speak.
</ParamField>

### Response

<ResponseField name="status" type="string">
  Can be `success` or `error`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="call_id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the call (present only if status is `success`)
</ResponseField>
