## Billing Overview

Bland charges based on the actual resources consumed across voice, SMS, and other interaction types. Enterprise accounts may be eligible for custom pricing.

## Pricing Changes

**Connected minute rates are now plan-based for all self-serve customers.**

Previously, Bland plans only differed by usage limits. We're updating pricing to better reflect the value in each tier. Teams on higher plans benefit from lower per-minute rates along with higher limits, making it easier to scale confidently.

### New Pricing Structure (Effective December 5th, 2025)

| Plan       | Price   | Connected Minute Rate | Transfer Time Rate |
|------------|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Start**  | Free    | $0.14 / min          | $0.05 / min       |
| **Build**  | $299    | $0.12 / min          | $0.04 / min       |
| **Scale**  | $499    | $0.11 / min          | $0.03 / min       |

### Pricing Example

Here's how billing works for a typical call:

**Scenario:** A 10-minute call where the AI agent talks for 8 minutes, then transfers to a human for 2 minutes.

| Plan | Connected Time (10 min) | Transfer Time (2 min) | Total |
|------|------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| **Start** | 10 x \$0.14 = \$1.40 | 2 x \$0.05 = \$0.10 | **$1.50** |
| **Build** | 10 x \$0.12 = \$1.20 | 2 x \$0.04 = \$0.08 | **$1.28** |
| **Scale** | 10 x \$0.11 = \$1.10 | 2 x \$0.03 = \$0.06 | **$1.16** |

<Note>
Connected time is the full AI conversation duration of the call. Transfer time is billed additionally when the call is transferred to a human using Bland-provided numbers. BYOT (Bring Your Own Twilio) customers do not pay transfer fees. See [Bland Voice Billing](#bland-voice-billing) for more details.
</Note>

### Automatic Transition Credits

To make this transition easier, every organization has received an automatic credit based on the last 30 days of usage. This credit reflects the difference between what you paid under the previous standard rate ($0.09/min) and what the same usage would have cost under your new plan rate.

**Example calculation (Start plan):**
- Previous month spend: \$40.00 at \$0.09/min = 444.44 connected minutes
- Same usage at new rate: 444.44 min x \$0.14/min = \$62.22
- **Credit applied: $22.22**

This one-time credit has been automatically applied to your organization and will support your upcoming usage. Each organization's credit is calculated based on their own prior month of connected minutes.

<Accordion title="Frequently Asked Questions">

<Accordion title="Why are you making this pricing change?">
Previously, all customers paid the same per-minute rate regardless of their plan tier. This change aligns pricing with the value each plan provides. Higher tiers now get better rates in addition to higher limits, creating a clearer upgrade path and fairer cost structure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="When did this take effect?">
The new plan-based pricing is now active as of December 5th, 2025.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How will this affect my current bill?">
Your bill impact depends on your current plan and usage:
- **Start plan users:** Connected minutes increase from \$0.09 to \$0.14/min
- **Build plan users:** Connected minutes increase from \$0.09 to \$0.12/min  
- **Scale plan users:** Connected minutes increase from \$0.09 to \$0.11/min

Transfer rates also become plan-specific. Use the examples above to estimate your new costs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know if I should change plans?">
Review your usage patterns on the [billing dashboard](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/pay). If you consistently use high volume, upgrading to Build or Scale will give you a lower per-minute rate and higher limits. Use the pricing examples above to estimate potential savings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Did I receive any credits for this transition?">
Yes! Every organization received an automatic one-time credit based on the last 30 days of usage. This credit covers the difference between the old flat rate ($0.09/min) and your current plan-based rate (if you are currently on a plan, your billing rate is updated to reflect it). The credit has already been applied to your account and will be automatically applied towards future usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What do I do if my usage is higher than the Scale plan?">
If your usage is higher than the Scale plan, we would love to talk to you about your needs and how an enterprise contract could help. Please contact us at sales@bland.ai.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do Enterprise contracts get affected?">
Existing Enterprise contracts with custom pricing agreements are not affected by this change. Contact your account manager if you have questions about your specific agreement.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are there any tips for keeping good visibility on my usage?">
Yes! Here are some ways to monitor and control your usage:

- Check your [billing dashboard](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/pay) regularly to see real-time usage and spending
- Set up usage alerts if available in your dashboard to get notified when approaching credit limits
- Set up Alarms to monitor if call lengths begin to increase past a certain amount
- Monitor your daily/hourly caps. Hitting limits means calls get rejected rather than incurring unexpected charges

## Bland Voice Billing

| Component        | Description                                                   | Price         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Call Time**    | Prorated to the exact second. Only active call time is counted. | $0.09 / min   |
| **Transfer (BYOT)** | Free when using your own Twilio number.                      | $0.00 / min   |
| **Transfer (Bland)** | Billed at a reduced rate when using Bland-provided numbers. Free for BYOT customers. | $0.025 / min  |
| **Outbound Minimum** | Minimum charge per outbound call attempt using Bland's telephony. | $0.015 / call |
| **Voicemail**    | Billed as part of standard call time.                         | $0.09 / min   |
| **Failed Calls** | Minimum charge applies if using Bland's telephony.           | $0.015 / call |

## Warm Transfer Billing

| Component           | Description                                               | Price         |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Proxy Agent**    | Charged for talk time while active.                        | $0.09 / min   |
| **Primary Agent**  | Billing stops once the agent disconnects.                  | $0.09 / min   |
| **Merged Calls**   | Billed for transfer duration. This is free for BYOT customers.  | $0.025 / min   |


### Example Warm Transfer Billing Diagram

<img 
  src="../tutorials/tutorials-assets/warm-transfer/wt_cost_diagram.jpg" 
  style={{ width: "100%", borderRadius: "0.5rem", marginTop: "1rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}
  alt="Warm Transfer Billing Diagram"
/>

Above is an example of a warm transfer duration and how it's billed. A warm transfer starts with the Bland agent speaking with the customer. When a transfer is needed, the agent initiates a second proxy agent call in the background. Depending on the warm transfer configuration, the customer either hears hold music or continues speaking with the Bland agent. That difference changes the billing rate while the customer waits for the proxy agent call to merge.

Once the proxy agent call is created, it's billed at the Bland rate, \$0.09/min in this example. After the calls merge, the time is billed at the transfer rate, \$0.025/min in this example.

Per the table above, transfer rate is free when using a BYOT number.

## SIP Billing

Bland supports SIP connectivity for enterprise customers who wish to connect directly from their own telephony infrastructure or contact center platform.

| Component               | Description                                                                                   | Price                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **SIP (Inbound / Outbound)** | Calls routed through Bland’s SIP endpoints. Standard call rates apply; SIP cost is included. | $0.09 / min                |
| **SIP (BYOT)**           | When using your own Twilio or SIP provider, all carrier fees are billed to your account. Bland still applies its standard call rate. | $0.09 / min + carrier rate |
| **SIP Termination Fee**  | Twilio charges Bland $0.004 / min for SIP traffic that terminates on Bland infrastructure. This cost is currently absorbed by Bland and not passed through. | —                          |

### SIP Pricing Notes

- SIP usage is billed the same as standard voice minutes, regardless of whether the call is made through PSTN or SIP.  
- When calls terminate on Bland's Twilio SIP infrastructure, Bland incurs a $0.004 / min fee to Twilio for that call leg.  
- There is currently no discounted or specialized SIP rate; the SIP cost is treated as equivalent to standard call usage. 
- Future enterprise plans may include dedicated SIP pricing tiers depending on call volume and termination routing.

## SMS Billing

| Type            | Rate         |
