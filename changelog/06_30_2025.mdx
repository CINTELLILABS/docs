### Upgraded Babel Model + Language Locking

We’ve rolled out an upgrade to Babel, our in-house transcription engine—along with new language-locked variants for improved accuracy.

- Babel becomes more accurate over the course of the call using contextual speech refinement
- New API options support locked languages like English, Spanish, French, and more (e.g. `babel-en`, `babel-es`, `babel-fr`)
- Language locking improves recognition accuracy by removing the need for auto-detection
- Low-confidence audio is now marked with [inaudible], allowing your agent to respond or prompt naturally

If your callers consistently speak the same language, we recommend trying a locked-language model for higher transcription quality.

### Improvements

- You can now configure a **"Go to Node"** action inside the **Press Button Node**
- Adds `isRetry: true` support in post call webhooks to determine if the call was retried
- Improved JSON validation when uploading conversational pathways to an organization
- Fixes test case issues affecting test coverage stability
- Fixes bug where if proxy agent presses button, primary call would go into end state (leave voicemail, or go to a node)
- Fixes a bug in pathway duplication logic
- Adds version tracking to pathway editor, so when a customer updates an old system of a pathway, it will error:
> *This pathway was updated elsewhere. Please refresh the page to get the latest changes.*
- Fixes a crash that could occur when referencing undefined variables in execution
