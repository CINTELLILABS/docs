### SIP Configuration UI (Enterprise)

A new interface is now available under **Phone Numbers â†’ Add Existing Phone Number** for managing SIP numbers directly from the dashboard.

- View and edit SIP routes without using the API
- Configure SIP endpoint, port, transport protocol, and credentials
- Enable Secure Media (SRTP) and add custom SIP headers mapped to Bland variables

This dashboard simplifies outbound SIP configuration for Enterprise users.

- Fixes edge case where certain outbound calls were exceeding their preset maximum duration.
- Fixes error preventing background audio from being attached to inbound phone numbers.
