### Web Widget

We're happy to release our new [web widget feature](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/web-widget), which allows users to embed their pathway chats into their own websites.

- Embed conversational flows directly into your website
- Built on the logic of your voice pathways
- Fully customizable with your own branding from within the Bland dashboard
- Quick and easy to implement
