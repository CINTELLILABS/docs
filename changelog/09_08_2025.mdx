### JWT Signature Configuration [Enterprise]

Protect your webhook and API integrations with JWT authentication. Our new asymmetric JWT signing gives you cryptographic proof that requests are genuine, helping keep out unauthorized access and block replay attacks.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Zero-trust security**: Eliminates shared secret vulnerabilities with public key verification
- **Automatic protection**: Built-in token expiration and unique identifiers prevent replay attacks  
- **Seamless rotation**: Update keys without service disruption
- **Enterprise ready**: Minimal configuration for maximum security

All outbound requests now include signed JWTs that you can verify using your public keys through our JWKS endpoint, so you can be confident in request integrity.

Learn more about implementation in our [JWT Authentication documentation](https://docs.bland.ai/enterprise-features/jwt-authentication).
