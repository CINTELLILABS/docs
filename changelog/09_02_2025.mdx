### Live Translation for Warm Transfers [Enterprise]

With live translation enabled, Bland agents stay in warm transfer calls and act as real-time translators between both parties. 

For example, when User A speaks Spanish, it's played through User B's phone while the Bland agent simultaneously translates it to English for User B. When User B responds in English, the agent translates it back to Spanish for User A, creating seamless cross-language communication.

Feel free to try it out for youself in your transfer node configuration.

### Multiple Knowledge Bases

Pathway nodes now support attaching multiple knowledge bases simultaneously. This enables agents to leverage different knowledge sources that apply to specific conversation points, or dynamically shift the number of KBs based on conversation context. Your agent will use the combined context from all attached knowledge bases when generating responses, providing more comprehensive and accurate information.
