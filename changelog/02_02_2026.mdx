### Watchtower [Enterprise]

Enterprise hallucination prevention that addresses incorrect value extraction and false loop condition assessments at scale.

- Runs critical decisions multiple times in parallel to identify consensus patterns, then automatically flags low confidence when outputs diverge across variable extractions and loop conditions
- When unreliable results are detected, retry with clarification prompts, transfer to human agents, or route to alternative pathway nodes
- Surfaces unreliable nodes and uses fail-safe protocols that handle uncertainty gracefully instead of returning confident but incorrect responses

      This node uses watchtower to enable guard rails specifically on the loop condition, which will transfer the call if the condition fails after unreliable results are detected
