### Improvements

**Voice & Audio**
- [Enterprise] Enhanced voice pronunciation with automatic currency conversion for more natural speech patterns. Read more about it [here](https://www.bland.ai/blogs/how-bland-is-fixing-the-biggest-flaw-in-ai-voices)!
- Audio-based variable extraction is now available to improve accuracy. The model processes audio directly instead of relying on an intermediate speech-to-text step, using richer signal to extract variables. Enable this under Advanced Variable Extraction Settings in your pathway nodes.

**Call Logs & Filtering**
- Fixed call filtering to include calls not linked to any pathway when using "NOT" operator filters
- Enhanced call log export functionality with support for additional filtering options and improved reliability
- Added pre and post transfer duration fields to call export data for better call analytics
- Refreshed call logs interface with improved visual design for better user experience
