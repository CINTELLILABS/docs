### BTTS V2 Voice Launch

We are excited to roll out major improvements to our text to speech experience over the next week. When your account is upgraded, you will see a new voice appear tagged as BTTSV2 in your [voices page](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/voices).

BTTSV2 is significantly more expressive and stable, and is the new version of voices that we are rolling out to customers going forward.

Attached is a [prompting guide](/tutorials/btts) that outlines best practices for using these new voices. In most cases, BTTSV2 should behave one to one with existing voices, though some differences may appear depending on usage and prompting.

**Supported Languages:**
English, Spanish, German, French, Czech, Dutch, Bulgarian, Chinese, Danish, Estonian, Finnish, Korean, Japanese, Norwegian, Italian, Polish, and Russian.

**Experimental Support:**
Hungarian, Swedish, Romanian, Greek, Portuguese, Indonesian, Serbo-Croatian, Slovenian, Slovak, and Welsh.

**TLDR** — Voices flagged as Legacy in the voice UI will be upgraded to BTTSV2. All other V1 voices will remain unchanged, so your experience will stay the same if you are not using a legacy voice.

### Triggers and Automations [Beta]

Automate your workflows with visual trigger builders that respond to events from Salesforce, Notion, and more.

- Build out your automations through our drag-and-drop UI
- Connect to trigger sources such as Salesforce, Notion, and more soon
- Configure actions to automatically send calls, and soon webhooks, SMS, and Slack messages
- Adjust trigger conditions with scheduling (immediate, business hours, custom) and conditional logic with change detection (e.g., only trigger if Status changed to "Hot")
- Test with mock data before deploying and track execution history
