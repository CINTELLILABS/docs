### Improvements

**Call Logs & Management**
- [Enterprise] Enhanced call logs table with improved filtering for calls made through SIP
- Added timezone awareness to call logs filters so date filtering now respects your local timezone
- Fixed query parameter handling that was causing errors when using more than three filters on large volumes of calls

**API & Development**
- Enhanced [batch API](/api-v1/post/batches) validation to properly recognize `persona_id` as a parameter in the global object, bringing parity with the [/v1/calls](/api-v1/post/calls) endpoint
- [Enterprise] Improved reliability of [post call webhooks](/tutorials/post-call-webhooks) being sent with delayed citation webhooks

**Knowledge Base**
- Fixed bug that prevented uploading specific PDF files as knowledge bases
- Fixed pathway chat simulations bug to properly include knowledge base results in conversation context
