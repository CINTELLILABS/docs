### Pathway UI Update

Complete redesign of the pathway testing interface with resizable panels, advanced debugging capabilities, and conversation branching.

- Drag to resize panels or open floating windows, and pin key messages for quick access, with your layout preferences saved between sessions
- Branch new conversation paths from any message during testing to explore alternate scenarios without restarting
- Toggle detailed execution logs showing secondary actions (loop conditions, variable extractions, routing) 
- Run test simlulations on historic calls using your drafted node changes

      Along with converting our node views into draggable panels, you can pop them out to create floating windows

      At any point during a test chat, edit your user message to branch to a new conversation, where that input was used and subsequent agent responses are changed. You can view and swith between these from the conversation UI

### Upgraded Memory

Massive update to our memory feature, bridging voice and SMS modalities. [Learn more about memory](https://docs.bland.ai/tutorials/memories)

- Memory context automatically synced between phone calls and SMS conversations for the same contact
- New memory UI that displays new information added to contact based on their conversation
- Enable or disable memory per pathway and persona

---

### Improvements

**Personas**
- [BLA-5243] Personas now support SMS conversations with full feature parity to voice calls

**Pathways & Routing**
- [BLA-5222] Transfer pathway node now accepts variables as input for dynamic pathway routing

**UI/UX Improvements**
- [BLA-5443] Added prompter role to permission set for granular access control. Prompters are able to read and write pathways, but cannot publish or deploy
