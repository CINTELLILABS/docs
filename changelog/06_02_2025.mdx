### Voice & Call Handling

**Pause/Resume Agent Speech**  
- Improvements to help prevent the agent from talking over the user.
- Agent speech is paused while the user is speaking, and this supersedes all "block interruptions" logic. Speech is automatically resumed when they finish speaking if the interruption was blocked, or is cancelled and replaced by the new response generation.
- Minor fixes for background_track: "none"

**Transfer Recording Controls**  
Introduces a setting in the org preferences tab that allows you to stop the twilio recording after Bland regular or warm transfers
