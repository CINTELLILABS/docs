### Improvements

**Voice & Audio**
- Improved voice cloning UI with enhanced form validation and loading indicators
- Changed the default call interruption threshold to 500ms. Our Solutions and Core Engineering teams have tested this over months and found 500 ms to be a more appropriate default, leading to more natural pauses and improved handling of speech delays.

- Introduced message IDs for SMS conversations
