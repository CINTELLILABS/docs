### Improvements

**Live Translation & Transfers**
- Fallback to regular warm transfer if live translation bridge initialization fails
- Enhanced merge prompts for warm transfer calls with live translation

**Pathways & Routing**
- Added pathway version JSON upload functionality
- Transfer node extension field now supports variable substitution using `{{variable_name}}` syntax
- Strengthened current year validation in scheduling node

**Knowledge Base & Personas**
- Fixed inbound persona calls to properly reference configured webhook endpoints
- Integrated knowledge base gaps detection with personas

**Voice & Audio**
- Increased background noise threshold by 20%

**Web Widget**
- Improved session management after periods of user inactivity

**API & Development**
- Fixed webhook timeout handling where calls would go silent due to missing BlandStatusCode. Now properly sets status code to 0 on timeout to allow routing logic execution
