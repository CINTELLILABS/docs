### [Knowledge Base Gaps](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/knowledge-bases?tab=home)

Automatically detect when customers ask questions your current knowledge base can't answer, so your team can quickly find and fix the gaps

Key Features
- **Intelligent Gap Detection**: Automatically identifies unanswered questions during your calls and surfaces the specific scenarios and questions where your knowledge base falls short
- **Seamless Resolution Workflow**: Add missing information directly to your knowledge base through an integrated UI
- **Performance Analytics**: Metrics and reporting (coming soon) to track coverage improvements and agent effectiveness over time

This feature lifts agent performance by continuously sharpening the knowledge base. Agents start strong and, through ongoing gap detection and fixes, quickly handle a broader range of customer questions with more confidence
