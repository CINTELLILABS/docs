### Improvements

**Pathways & Routing**
- Improved timeout rate when generating pathways
- Persists new pathway nodes/edges after pathway transfers, fixing "nodes or edges missing" errors when warm transfers trigger reconnections

**SMS**
- [Enterprise] SMS logs maintain text whitespace formatting

**Citations**
- [Enterprise] Rejects call creation if citation_schema_ids are included but record: false is set

**Web Widget**
- Allow searching through web widget logs
- Adds support for post chat webhooks for web widget

**API & Development**
- [Enterprise] Fixed race condition where both citations and post call webhook would be sent separately while combined webhooks are enabled
