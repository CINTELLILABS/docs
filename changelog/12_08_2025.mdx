### [Integrations Platform](https://app.bland.ai/dashboard/tools)

Connect Bland to tools like Salesforce, Notion, and scheduling tools so AI calls automatically create leads, book meetings, update records, and trigger workflows without manual effort.

Complete shift from a legacy tool setup to an enterprise grade integrations platform, fundamentally changing how AI phone calls connect to your business systems
- Authentication is now automatic through OAuth and forms auto-populate from connected accounts instead of requiring manual setup
- Tool configurations are reusable resources that scale across unlimited use cases rather than one-off setups
- Enterprise-grade architecture supports the most popular services, with custom UI/UX for each integration instead of generic interfaces

**Live Integrations:**
- **Salesforce CRM**: Complete customer lifecycle management with accounts, contacts, leads, opportunities, tasks, events, and custom SOQL queries
- **Cal.com & Calendly**: Comprehensive scheduling automation with booking creation and availability management
- **Notion**: Read from your Notion knowledge bases and use them directly in your calls
- **SMS Integration**: Native outbound SMS messaging through Bland for enterprise customers

We will continue to add more tools and integrations here, so stay tuned for updates!
