title: Geospatial Dialing
---

Geospatial dialing guarantees the highest pickup rate for your outbound calls by using the most optimal phone number from your phone number inventory.



## Step 1: Setup your dialing pool.

- Curate a list of phone numbers that you would like to dial from --  it is generally recommended to get multiple numbers per area code, but not strictly required.
- Send this list of phone numbers to Bland. They will send back a `pool_id` that you will specify when creating your outbound call requests.

## Step 2: Create your outbound call request.

- Specify the `geospatial_dialing` parameter in your outbound call request with the value as the `pool_id` that you received from your Bland.

## Cycling your numbers (Optional)

-  Reach out to your Bland Contact to cycle your numbers. If needed, they can expose API endpoints to allow doing this programmatically.
