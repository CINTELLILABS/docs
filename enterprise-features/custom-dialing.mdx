title: Custom Dialing
---

Custom dialing guarantees the highest pickup rate for your outbound calls by using the most optimal phone number from your phone number inventory.

## Step 1: Setup your dialing pool.

- Curate a list of phone numbers that you would like to dial from --  it is generally recommended to get multiple numbers per area code, but not strictly required.
- Send this list of phone numbers to Bland. They will send back a `pool_id` that you will specify when creating your outbound call requests.

## Step 2: Create your outbound call request.

- Specify the `dialing_strategy` parameter with `type: "custom_pool"`  in your outbound call request, providing the associated `pool_id` value that you received from Bland. For more details, [see the documentation](/api-v1/post/calls#2-custom-pool).

## Cycling your numbers (Optional)

-  Reach out to your Bland Contact to cycle your numbers. If needed, they can expose API endpoints to allow doing this programmatically.

## API Endpoints

Custom dialing pools can now be accessed via the [API](/api-v1/get/custom-dialing-pool).
