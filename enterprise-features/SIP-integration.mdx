title: "SIP Integration"
description: "Configure and manage SIP for call routing to and from Bland."

---

## Overview

Bland supports **inbound and outbound SIP**, allowing customers to direct calls from their SIP provider to Bland for handling - or to direct Bland to make contact with their SIP provider.

This guide provides:

* SIP connection details
* Requirements and security settings
* Instructions for attaching, verifying, updating, and detaching SIP routes via Bland's API
* Schema definitions and usage patterns

---

## Entitlement Requirement

All `/sip` endpoints are protected by an entitlement check.

Your organization must have the `SIP` entitlement enabled to use SIP features. If not, all requests to the `/sip` routes will return:

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "error": "SIP_NOT_ENABLED",
      "message": "SIP is not enabled for this organization"
    }
  ]
}
```

Contact support to have SIP enabled for your Enterprise organization.

## SIP Termination Details

**SIP Signaling Endpoint:**

You must use TCP over TLS. Bland does not accept UDP for SIP messages. We do support UDP over S/RTP for media streams. mTLS is not required at this time.
```
US1:

us1.sip.bland.ai:5061;transport=tls

--
EU1:

eu1.sip.bland.ai:5061;transport=tls

--
AU1:

Coming Soon
```


**Static IP Addresses of the SIP Signalling Server(s):**

```
US1:

35.80.235.26
54.189.4.67

--
EU1:

52.17.69.204
52.210.181.150

--
AU1:

Coming Soon
```

**Static IP Addresses of the Media Stream Server(s):**

Bland does not provide static addresses for Media Stream Servers. As part of the SDP negotiation, our SIP Signalling Servers will provide you with the location of an available Media Stream endpoint. Through this, Bland is able to confidently scale our Media Stream capabilities without the need for NAT.

**Supported Codecs:**

* Currently Supported: PCMU, PCMA
* Coming Soon: Opus, G722

**Security Requirements:**

* SIP Signaling: TLS 1.2 or higher
* RTP Media: SRTP using AES_CM_128_HMAC_SHA1_80
* `From` Header FQDN: Bland will enforce validity of the FQDN provided for in your `From` header. If this should be the same as the signaling endpoint, or a non-valid FQDN, we may reject your request(s) in the future.

**Other Configurations:**

* RTCP: Uses port RTP + 1
* DTMF: RFC 2833 (Out-of-band via RTP payload)
* Transport: TCP over TLS


* Number Format: +E.164 or E.164 (both supported for origination and termination)
* SIP Registration: Not required (Bland determines routing based on predefined configurations configurable below.)

## API Reference

### Attach SIP Endpoint

`POST /sip/attach`

Attach a SIP configuration to a phone number.

<ParamField query="phone_number" type="string">
  The phone number to associate with the SIP configuration. Must be in E.164 format.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="directions" type="array">
  An array of directions for the SIP routing. Valid values: `inbound`, `outbound`. If outbound, you must also provide a `sip_endpoint`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="service" type="string">
  Must be set to `sip`.
</ParamField>

```bash Example Request
curl -X POST https://api.bland.ai/v1/sip/attach \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phone_number": "+14150000000",
    "directions": [
      { "type": "inbound" },
      { 
          "type": "outbound", 
          "sip_endpoint": "sip:your.provider.com", // FQDN Only. Port must be defined here, or in options. Prefixed with `sip:`
          "options": {
              "port": 1234, // Will overwrite any port defined in your sip_endpoint.
              "transport": "tls", // Other available: tls, tcp
              "secure_media": "true", // True, False
              "sip_username": "bland", // Optional

### Verify SIP Number (Outbound)

`PUT /sip/verify`

To prove that you own the number, you'll need to perform a one-time verification.

Be ready! Once you make this request, you'll receive a phone call to the specified phone number, from `+14157234000` - which will require you to input the code returned from the below request into your keypad.

<ParamField query="phone_number" type="string">
  The phone number to verify SIP calling from. It must be attached to your organization first before attempting to verify.
</ParamField>

```bash Example Request
curl -X PUT https://api.bland.ai/v1/sip/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "phone_number": "+14150000000",
  }'
```

### Update SIP Direction

`POST /sip/update`

Update a phone numberâ€™s SIP routing direction.

<ParamField query="phone_number" type="string">

### Detach SIP Endpoint

### Making your first SIP Call (Outbound)

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "Say hi to the nice person!",

## Notes

- Phone numbers can be attached independently for inbound and outbound routing via the API.
- All requests must conform to the expected schema; invalid payloads will be rejected with a 400 response.
- Each API response includes a success status and, if applicable, an error message to aid debugging.
