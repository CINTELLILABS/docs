title: Dedicated infrastructure
---

Dedicated infrastructure comes with a few benefits:

1. Bland will host the dedicated instance anywhere in the world, shifting infrastructure to decrease latency by as much as 15%.
2. Automatic updates will be paused, ensuring production deployments have full stability. Changes will be introduced at whatever cadence the customer prefers.
3. The endpoint will have it's own priority call queue (and calls will dispatch nearly instantly)
